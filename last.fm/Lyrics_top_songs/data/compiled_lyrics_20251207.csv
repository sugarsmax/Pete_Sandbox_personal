Controlling the pain of you with the palm of her hand
Yeah she's got control of you, and you need it

Who knew?
The door opens up and lets some light in
Someone calls and takes the blindfold off
You are home to see a woman standing
Someone holds to knock you out
Who knew?
A heavy beating, the pounding of your heart
You start to sweat and you scream out
Something black answers back from the dungeon
And you smile

Only to realize it never really was

She had a place in his life
