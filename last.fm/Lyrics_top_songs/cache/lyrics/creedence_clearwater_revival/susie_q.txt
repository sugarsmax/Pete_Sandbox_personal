Well, take me back down where cool water flow, y’all
Let me remember things I love, oh
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
Walkin' along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight

I can hear the bullfrog callin' me, oh
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water
Shoo fly, dragon fly, get back you mother
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across a-Green River
Well


Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, "You're gonna find the world be smolderin'
If you get lost, come on home to Green River"
Well


Oh, Suzie Q, oh, Suzie Q
Oh, Suzie Q, baby I love you
Suzie Q
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk, I like the way you talk
Suzie Q
