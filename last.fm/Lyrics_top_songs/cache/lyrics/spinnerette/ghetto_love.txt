Hey now, there now
It's a game to be played out
Amongst thieves of the heart and the whores of the ego

Ooohhh, ooohhh
Ooohhh, ooohhh
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

Hey now, there now
Kiss everyone's ailments
See them rise up, exalt and illuminate

Ooohhh, ooohhh
Ooohhh, ooohhh
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

Humanity is a deer in the headlights
The road is covered in blood
Free yourself with a dagger from above
A crossbow of faith

You sold your heart for the primal experience
Gave up on love for a medal malevolence
You fill yourself with the fire of innocence
A karmic stain will bring back through the gates again

Oh, how I wonder what will become of us
I'm just a girl out looking for love, ooh
Oh, how I wonder what will become of us
I'm just a girl out looking for love, ooh

You want in me what you see is a testament
You never know when you love what you'll manifest
I'm Joan of Arc on a mission avenge love's death
I'm gonna win, I'll never give in

Ooohhh, ooohhh
Ooohhh, ooohhh
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

Oh, how I wonder what will become of us
I'm just a girl out looking for love, ooh
Oh, how I wonder what will become of us
I'm just a girl out looking for love, ooh

I'm just a girl out looking for love
I'm just a girl out looking for love
I'm just a girl out looking for love
I'm just a girl out looking for love
