White lines on the table
Look like a road, like a road, like a road
Then there's the message that we're hooked
Dominos, dominos, dominos
I think you'll notice whoever you are
Cheap sex in a pick-up truck
Is a mess, is a mess, is a mess
Then there's the message that we're fucked
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Hey what's your name?
I'll give you anything you want
Hey what's your name?
I'll take everything you got
All aboard the drunk express
Bottles of wine in excess
Lines of gold to fill your holes
Holes so deep where no one knows
White lines on the table
Look like a road, like a road, like a road
Then there's the message that we're hooked
Dominos, dominos, dominos
I think you'll notice whoever you are
All aboard the drunk express
Bottles of wine in excess
Lines of gold to fill your holes
Holes so deep where no one knows
Hey what's your name?
I'll give you anything you want
Hey what's your name?
I'll take everything you got
Hey what's your name?
I'll give you anything you want
Hey what's your name?
I'll take everything you got
