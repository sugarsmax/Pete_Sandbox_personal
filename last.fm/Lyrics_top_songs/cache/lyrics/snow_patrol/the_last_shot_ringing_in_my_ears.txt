Take her home, take her past this evening
I'm not sure, sure if I believe you
You carry a gun for fun, you use it twice as easy
I'm sure she is, she is someone's daughter

I couldn't even feel that it was wrapped around my head

I don't know what she's done, I don't even want to think about it
She was beautiful, the prettiest girl I've ever seen
I saw everything things I hoped I'd never see
She got away from him and got on a plane this morning

I couldn't even feel like it was wrapped around my head
I couldn't even feel like it was wrapped around my head
So I'm down, so I'm down, so I'm down, so I'm down

I am not sure what she's done but don't even wanna think about it
She made me answer this but instead I remember now

I couldn't even feel like it was wrapped around my head
So I'm down, so I'm down, so I'm down, so I'm down
So I'm down, so I'm down, so I'm down, so I'm down

I’m at the airport, fucking split
I’m on the next flight
