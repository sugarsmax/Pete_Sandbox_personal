My hate was born in the club that's why I'm leaving
This place is more than a lie, you should believe me
I am not happy here. You're not grown men, you're just kids playing
So many things that you say I don't agree with
You're living hypocrisy. I can't compete with
You don't look happy here. You're not grown ups you're just kids playing
If I lose my friends I hope that I'm told. I hope that someone tells me
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say
All the things we never say. They'll never let you
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say
You're telling more than a lie I don't believe you
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say
All the things we never say. They'll never let you
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say
You're telling more than a lie I don't believe you
So many things we don't say, so many things we should say
If I lose my friends, I hope I'm told, I hope that someone tells me
If I lose my friends, I hope I'm told, I hope that someone tells me
If I lose my friends, I hope I'm told, I hope that someone tells me
If I lose my friends, I hope I'm told, I hope that someone tells me
