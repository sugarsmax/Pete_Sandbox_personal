I see no chains or fences
I see no gates of steel
I see no cellblock lockdown
I see no walls at all
Let me tell you a little secret :

I’m a free animal

I see no hanging pay check
I see no punching clocks
I see no snakes and ladders
I see no golden watch
All together now

I’m a free animal
La! La! La! La! La! La!

If only in your mind, you can be set free
Then maybe on your skin, you can be set free
Then maybe in your home, you can be set free
Then maybe in the world, you can be set free
Set yourself free
Set yourself free

I’m a free animal!
I'm a free animal!
