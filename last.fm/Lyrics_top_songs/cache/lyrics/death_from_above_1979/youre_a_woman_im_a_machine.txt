Take what you want, my head is full
Take what you need, my price is good
You want it all, just like you should
Your thoughts are pure, just like they should
Be what you want, you want it all
I've seen it once, I've seen it all

Now that it's over this weight is off my shoulder
Now that it's over this weight is off my shoulder
Now that it's over I love you more and more
Now that it's over I love you more and more

I know that you would take my hand
If I were to give you the chance
You want it all, just like you should
Our thoughts are pure, our thoughts are good
Be what you want, you'll have it all
I've seen it once, we've seen it all

Now that it's over this weight is off my shoulder
Now that it's over I love you more and more
