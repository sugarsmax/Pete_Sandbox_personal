I was born on a highway in a train wreck
With a heart that was beatin' outta my chest
So now I follow it around the world; I can't keep up
If I don't get it soon, I know I'll bleed until I drop

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

There's a darkness and a hollow on the highway
Every cross on the roadside tells a story
So now I follow it around the world; I can't keep up
The story never ends as long as we have blood and guts

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

It ran off the track
Eleven, seventy-nine
While the immigrants slept
There wasn't much time
The mayor came callin'
And got 'em out of bed
They packed up their families
And headed up wind
A poison cloud
A flamin' sky
Two hundred thousand people
And no one died
And all before the pocket dial
Yeah!

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'
Now I'm stranded, tied to the tracks
There's no hero; there's no villain
There's nobody I can blame
The story's still the same
I'm never satisfied
It's a problem with my brain

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
