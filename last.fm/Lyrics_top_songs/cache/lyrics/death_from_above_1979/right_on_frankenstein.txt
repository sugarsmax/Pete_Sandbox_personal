I dig my own graves lately
I don't need any help
Just let me sit here quiet
In the earth by myself

I don't wanna die, but I wanna be buried
Meet me at the gates of the cemetery

I've been a zombie lately
I got nothin' to say
Always too much talkin'
Not enough eatin' brains

I don't wanna die, but I wanna be buried
Leave me at the gates of the cemetery

I'll wait here 'til I'm ready

All my life, I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out nothing's new
It's the same old song, just a different tune
All my life, I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out nothing's new
It's the same old song, just a different tune

Right on, Frankenstein!
You've risen the dead
Lazarus pushed the stone off
Winced and went back to bed

I don't wanna die, but I wanna be buried
Leave me at the gates of the cemetery

You see the beast inside me
He pushes and shoves
Sensitive thugs need hugs
So why do I get no love?

I don't wanna die, but I wanna be buried
Leave me at the gates of the cemetery

I'll wait here 'til I'm ready

All my life, I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out nothing's new
It's the same old song, just a different tune
All my life, I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out nothing's new
It's the same old song, just a different tune


Right on, Frankenstein!
You don't believe in ghosts
Lightnin' strikes the body
And that is life to most
