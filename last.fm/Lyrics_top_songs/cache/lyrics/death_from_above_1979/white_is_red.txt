Frankie was a heart-breaker; I didn't know it at the start
She was only sixteen when she went and broke my heart

And she pulled up in her dad's car wearin' white
She said she knew a place where we could hide
She didn't have her license, but she told me I could drive
So I drove all night

"Why don't you leave me?" she asked that night
I said, "I'll stay; I know the kid is mine
I'd never leave you; it isn't right
Let's stay together until the end of time"

Oh, now the white is red
Can't get it outta my head
Oh, now the white is red

"I heard that there's a place where we can go
Across the state there's no one that we know
Or maybe rent a place where we can stay
Where what we have would go a longer way"

Then Frankie turned to me; she looked me in the eye
She said that I looked tired; she told me she could drive
I pulled up to the station, walked through the neon lights
Then she put her foot down, down, down, down

Why did you leave me alone that night?
You took off racing; the kid is mine
You left me standing out on the yellow line
The taillight's fading into the night

We crossed the line
We crossed the line
We crossed the line
We crossed the line

Oh, now the white is red
Can't get it outta my head
Oh, now the white is red

I don't know why she left, took off racin'
I ran down, yellow line, red lights fadin'
She went left, double line, outta love, outta time
I covered eyes; I know she crossed the line
She crossed the line
She crossed the line
She crossed the line
She crossed the line
She crossed the line
She crossed the line
She crossed the line
She crossed the line

Oh, now the white is red
Can't get it outta my head
Oh, now the white is red
