If my heart bruises, everybody loses
Oh, I can't stress enough
And on the weekend, everyone's my best friend
Oh, I don't believe them

If I can't see the end, I can't see the beginnin'
There's no crystal ball to see a happy endin'
I know I can't say that this will last forever
But I need you to know I don't want you to go

If my hand loses, everybody bruises
Oh, you gotta believe me
And if the house wins, everybody else sins
Oh, that's just the city

If I can't see the end, I can't see the beginnin'
There's no crystal ball to see a happy endin'
I know I can't say that this will last forever
But I need you to know I don't want you to go

It's not in the cards
There's no crystal ball
There's no way to predict who will take it all
Can't always have what you want
You know it's fun to try
I see you gettin' turned on
I know the reason why

If my heart bruises, everybody loses
Oh, you gotta believe me
And on the weekend, everyone's your best friend
Oh, I don't believe them
