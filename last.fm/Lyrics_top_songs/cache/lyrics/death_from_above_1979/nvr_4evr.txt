I wanted to leave
She said "I know what you mean
But it might be cool if you stick around"
"Got nothing to say"
She said "Just talk anyway
You got a real cool way of putting things down"

I know it's hard for you
To see, to see things through

I'm a lot like you so let's try to see where it goes
Don't go away too soon I'll follow
But never forever
Never forever

I wanted to preach
She said "Just wait up for me I've got a lot more me to think about"
I said "Go ahead I'll think about you as well
You know I'm not that sold on the settle down"

I know it's hard for you
To see, to see things through
I know it's hard for you
To see, to see straight through

I'm a lot like you so let's try to see where it goes
Don't go away too soon I'll follow
But never forever
Never forever

Anyway
What things happen anyway?

I know it's hard for you
To see, to see things through

I'm a lot like you so let's try to see where it goes
Don't go away too soon I'll follow
But never forever
Never forever
Never forever
