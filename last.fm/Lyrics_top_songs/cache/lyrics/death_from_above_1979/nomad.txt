Chosen
Things are chosen for you
Setting
Stones are thrown at you
Questions
Everything is outside
Settings
Sunset station petting shadows
Nomad never home
No matter where you go
Cut down like they cut you
No matter what you do
Messes
Wander through the ages
Faces
Hidden from the day
Shiny
Levels under touch you
Dreams are like
Water to the fires of nightmare lives
Nomad never home
No matter where you go
Push them like they push you
No matter what you do
Nomad never home
No matter where you go
