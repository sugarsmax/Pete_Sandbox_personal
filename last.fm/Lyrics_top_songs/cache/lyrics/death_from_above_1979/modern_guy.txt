Progress
Not a promise
Devil’s laugh
If you go too fast

I’m a modern guy
In a modern time

Looking back
Innocent sweet child life
Untouched by shadows and cold
Grow up fast, told you’re no good now
Just dessert, with nothing to ya

I’m a modern guy
In a modern time

The propaganda is getting to grandmas
The new lingo in all the households
Merry Christmas baby, struck from the record
Celebrate the great dawn of utopia

I’m a modern guy
In a modern time
I'm a modern guy
In a modern time

You can change the world if you change you

I’m a modern guy
I'm a modern guy
