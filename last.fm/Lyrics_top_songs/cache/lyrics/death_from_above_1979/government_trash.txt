Well you can't say nothin' if your money ain't right
'Cause that government trash will keep you up all night
Some folks work so hard they nearly break their backs
Don't step on the crack 'cause you know about that
Ah

Twenty-one, twenty-one
Nobody knows anything at twenty-one
Twenty-two, twenty-two
Nobody knows anything at twenty-two
But you're alright, alright
You know you're alright, alright

It's not a secret
Everybody has two sides
Look in the mirror
Starin' back in those eyes
Don't stop thinkin'
Lookin' out past the fog
I say do what you want
But just leave me alone

Nothin' is free
Call the police
They dress to kill
I dress to die
Ah

It's not a secret
Everybody has two sides
Look in the mirror
Starin' back in those eyes
Don't stop thinkin'
Lookin' out past the fog
I say do what you want
But just leave me alone
