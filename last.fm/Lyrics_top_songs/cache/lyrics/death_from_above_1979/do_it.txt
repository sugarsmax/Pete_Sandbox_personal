Ooh, I wish you well
And I hope someday your life turns out just like you planned
Ooh, well I hope you can
Find it in you to forget all the things I've said

Yeah, and I know you will
Cause you're my friend and that's the nicest thing I've said
All day, I hope to god
I hope to god that someday you will understand

I don't think that you understand the things we say are not always the things we feel you need to think before you make mistakes something may end up to link the reasons why we do the things we had to do one day maybe you prove me wrong and do what you do
