Oh you should see her now, we still love her now
She is going steady, but we're not ready
We're not ready, oh, to see her fall, to see her fall
To see her fall in love

I know you are getting older
We should never turn our shoulder
I have never seen you suffer
I will never hurt you mother
I know you are getting older
We should never turn our shoulder
I have never seen you suffer
I will never hurt you mother
I know you are getting older
We should never turn our shoulder

I will never make you suffer
I will never hurt you mother
