I saw you in a way
But that's another life
Maybe they're the same
I wonder where you are
Yesterday is gone
But it ain't far away
I guess it's far enough

I'm older in my head
My innocence is gone
I have the book you read
To help me carry on
What a price to pay
To feel like you're alive
I was blind when he said

Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
He said, but he was wrong

I'm your Jezebel (she said)
On my way to hell (she said)
What a price to pay
To feel like you're alive
She was blind when she said

Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
She said, but she was wrong

Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
