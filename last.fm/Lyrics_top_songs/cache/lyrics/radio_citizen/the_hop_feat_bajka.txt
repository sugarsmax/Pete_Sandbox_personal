Rolling in my Lacky in a twisted cap
And in the G´s back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the backseat P
Just do it rolling top down
Ready to fly on the streets
Ready to fly on the streets
Back in a twisted cap
Rolling in my Lacky in a twisted cap
And in the G´s back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the backseat P
Doing rolling top down
Ready to fly on the streets
Rolling in my Lacky in a twisted cap
And in the G´s back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the backseat P
Just do it rolling top down
Ready to fly on the streets
Ready to fly on the streets
Back in a twisted cap
Rolling in my Lacky in a twisted cap
And in the G´s back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the backseat P
Doing rolling top down
Ready to fly on the streets
Rolling in my Lacky in a twisted cap
And in the G´s back climbing up the coast like that
Tanqueray on ice in the backseat P
Just do it rolling top down
Ready to fly on the streets
Ready to fly on the streets
I love you
