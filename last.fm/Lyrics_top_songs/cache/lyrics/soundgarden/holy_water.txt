Holy water on the brain, and I'm losin' sleep
Holy Bible on the nightstand next to me
As I'm raped by another monkey circus freak
Tryin' to take my indignance away from me, from me

Yeah, yeah, holy water's rustin' me
Yeah, holy water's rustin' me
It's rustin' me
Rustin' me


Bloody murder is the best I've heard her scream
Holy devil in the flesh, some might believe
And they take thine majesty so seriously
'Cause it's the big lies more likely to be believed, believed

Yeah, yeah, holy water's rustin' me
Yeah, holy water's rustin' me
It's rustin' me
Rustin' me, yeah

Damn the water if it's life you wanna drink
Mind your mother if it makes you feel at ease
As you're raped by another monkey circus freak
'Cause it's the big lies more likely to be believed, believed

Yeah, yeah, holy water's rustin' me
Yeah, yeah, holy water's rustin' me
Yeah, holy water's rustin' me
It's rustin' me
Rustin' me

Rustin' me
Rustin' me, yeah
Rustin' me
