Oh!

There's no time to keep it low
I've been deaf, now I want noise
You stay down, but I won't be quiet
I'll hammer on until you fight

Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love, yeah
Hammer on 'till you fight

If you've got some time to kill
Slow resistance wins the war
Well, I know, yeah, but that's no way to go
You can't resist the louder pull

It's loud love
Yeah, loud love
Loud love
Loud love, yeah
Can't resist louder pull, yeah
Alright

That's right
I want something to explode
I've been deaf, now I want noise

Loud love
Yeah, loud love
Loud love
Yeah, loud love, love
Yeah
