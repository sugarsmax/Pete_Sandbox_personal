Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaah!

When new damage comes
It's a faceless poison
A new world order
It's new damage done

The wreck is goin' down, get out before you drown
The wreck is goin' down, get out before you drown

Get out, yeah

When new damage comes
It's a new word for plague
A new world order
A new word for hate

The wreck is goin' down, get out before you drown
The wreck is goin' down, get out before you drown

Get out, yeah
Before you drown
Get out, get out
Oh yeah

Hey! Ohhh!


When new damage comes
It's a new word for plague, yeah
A new world order
A new word for hate

The wreck is goin' down, get out before you drown
The wreck is goin' down, get out before you drown

Get out
Get out, get out, before you
Drown, before you drown
Get out, a-get out
And get out, get out, get out
Get out, oh yeah
Get out before you drown
Get out! Get out!
Before you drown, before you drown!
Before, before you drown!
