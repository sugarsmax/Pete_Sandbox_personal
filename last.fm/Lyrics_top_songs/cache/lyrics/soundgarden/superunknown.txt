If this isn't what you see
It doesn't make you blind
And if this doesn't make you feel
It doesn't mean you've died
Where the river's high
Where the river's high
If you don't want to be seen
Well, you don't have to hide
And if you don't want to believe
Well, you don't have to try
To feel alive

Yeah, alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind, and then it steals your

If this doesn't make you free
It doesn't mean you're tied
If this doesn't take you down
It doesn't mean you're high
If this doesn't make you smile
Yeah, you don't have to cry
If this isn't making sense
It doesn't make it lies

Oh, alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind, and then it steals your
Soul, oh

Get yourself afraid
Get yourself alone
Get yourself contained
Get yourself control
Control

Ooohhh

(Alive in the superunknown)
(Alive in the superunknown)
(Alive in the superunknown)
(Alive in the superunknown)
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
Alive in the superunknown
First it steals your mind, and then it steals your
First it steals your mind, and then it steals your
First it steals your mind, and then it steals your
Soul
