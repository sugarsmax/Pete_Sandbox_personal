Put your t-shirt on
Lay my head down
I know you see me now
Ow, no-ow
When the light gets dark
I'm gonna make you stay
Give you a headstart
'Cause I like the chase

Yeah you say what you wanna say now
It's not the time to sit and wait around
Come close and you can find your way around
Yeah you say what you wanna say now
It's not the time to sit and wait around
Come close and you can find your way around

Gonna turn back time
Wanna control it
Can we slow it down
Down, down
Baby wait
Satiate
Give me a headstart
You will like the chase

Yeah you say what you wanna say now
It's not the time to sit and wait around
Come close and you can find your way around
Yeah you say what you wanna say now
It's not the time to sit and wait around
Come close and you can find your way around

I will keep it all to you
And when you run I'll follow you
Oh oh

Yeah you say what you wanna say now
It's not the time to sit and wait around
Come close and you can find your way around
Yeah you say what you wanna say now
It's not the time to sit and wait around
Come close and you can find your way around

It's not the time to sit and wait around (it all)
Come close and you can find your way around (to you)
(And when) Yeah you say what you wanna say now (you run)
It's not the time to sit and wait around (I'll fo-)
Come close and you can find your way around (-low you)
(Oh oh)
