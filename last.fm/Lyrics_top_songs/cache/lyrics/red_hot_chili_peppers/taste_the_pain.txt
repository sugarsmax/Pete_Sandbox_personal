Flat on my back in a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling 'cause I cannot fall
Asleep tonight
No, not at all
Headlights flash across my bedroom wall
The crying eyes open 'cause I cannot fall
In love with you
No, not at all

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

Busted in two like a brittle stick
I cannot drink because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth, I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream, you know, I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do, uh

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Well aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Yeah, yeeeaaaah!


This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk, I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love
I am not alive

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Well aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

How the price gets paid, ayayayayay!
Well I got to pay the price
I think I'll walk away
'Cause I couldn't survey, I couldn't pay the price
I couldn't pay the price
