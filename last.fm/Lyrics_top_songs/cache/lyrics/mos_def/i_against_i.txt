I-ya, I against I
Flesh of my flesh, and mind of my mind
Two of a kind, but one won't survive
My images reflect in the enemy's eye
And his images reflect in mine the same time
I-ya, I-ya, I against I
Flesh of my flesh, and mind of my mind
Two of a kind, but one won't survive

Right here is where the end gon' start at
Conflict, contact, combat
Fighters stand where the land is marked at
Settle the dispute about who the livest
Three word answer — whoever survive this
Only one of us can ride forever
So you and I can't ride together
Can't live or can't die together
All we can do is collide together
So I skillfully apply the pressure
Won't stop until I'm forever one
A door step where death never come
Spread across time 'til my time never done
And I'm never done
Walk tall, why ever run?
When they move if I ever come?
Bad man never fret the war, tell 'em come
General we have the stock, the mad fire burn!

I-ya
I against I
Flesh of my flesh, and mind of my mind
Two of a kind, but one won't survive
My images reflect in the enemy's eye
And his images reflect in mine the same time
I-ya, I-ya
I against I
Flesh of my flesh, and mind of my mind
Two of a kind, but one won't survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive

Reign supreme in your U-N-I-V-E-R-S-E with the sharpness
Narrow row building, no space for partners
No space for drivers, no space for walkers
No space regardless
You're on my path? Then get off it
Hard-headed and unresponsive
Get they lives put on target with harshness
Come with the cannons sparkin', they darken
Who am I? One man squadron, monster
The fire this time that'd snatch your tomorrow
The thousand yard stare that'd pierce through your armor
You can get it on right now if you want to
But when ya front line get marched through, I warned you
You know who forever belong to

I-ya, I-ya
I against I
Flesh of my flesh, and mind of my mind
Two of a kind, but one won't survive
My images reflect in the enemy's eye
And his images reflect in mine the same time
I-ya, I-ya
I against I
Flesh of my flesh, and mind of my mind
Two of a kind, but one won't survive
My images reflect in the enemy's eyes
And his images reflect in mine, survive!
Survive, survive, survive, survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive
