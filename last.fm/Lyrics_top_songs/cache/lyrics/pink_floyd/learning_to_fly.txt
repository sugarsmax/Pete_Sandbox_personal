Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone, as my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought, I'd thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded, but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I

"Friction lock, set
Mixtures, rich
Propellers, fully forward
Flaps, set, ten degrees
Engine gauges and suction, check
Mixture set to maximum percent, recheck
Flight instruments
Altimeters, check both
Lights, on
Pitot heater, on
Strobes, on
Confirm 3-8 echo ready for departure
Hello again, this is now 129.4
129.4, it’s a go
3-8 echo cleared takeoff, the wind’s normal at ten knots
3-8 echo
Easy on the brakes, take it easy, it’s gonna roll this time
Just handle the power gradually, and it"

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds, I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I
