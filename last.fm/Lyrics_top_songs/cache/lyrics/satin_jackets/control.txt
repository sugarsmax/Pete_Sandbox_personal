The crashing feeling of the come down
Wakes me up from my dream now
The building up, never let down
Comes with no warning
Where someone told me

It’s so coming back to me
Pull me from reality
Is this how it’s supposed to be
Could it go differently (could it go differently)
It’s out of our control
It’s out of our control
It’s out of our control
It’s out of our control

The back and forth but going nowhere
We try and try but just can’t get there
You call it love, I call it unfair
You gave no warning
You could’ve told me

It’s so coming back to me
Pull me from reality
Is this how it’s supposed to be
Could it go differеntly (could it go differently)
It’s out of our control
It’s out of our control
It’s out of our control
It’s out of our control
