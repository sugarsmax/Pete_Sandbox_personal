Stay in the middle of the road at night
We're heading to towards Alaskan sky
Just hang on to me for the ride of your life
We'll come make the starts across the sky

But we'll go in alone
You and I will find our way home
But we'll go in alone
You and I will find our way home

Headed to the Northern Lights
The night has just begun
And we'll only wants to close the eyes
And take a trip around the sun

Headed to the Northern Lights
The night has just begun
And we'll only wants to close the eyes
And take a trip around the sun

We head to the future to feel so blind
So enough to stealth past
They trying to keep us safe and sound
But we're living in the world, the broken glass

Headed to the Northern Lights
The night has just begun
And we'll only wants to close the eyes
And take a trip around the sun

Headed to the Northern Lights
The night has just begun
And we'll only wants to close the eyes
And take a trip around the sun

We'll go in alone
You and I will find our way home
We'll go in alone

Headed to the Northern Lights
The night has just begun
And we'll only wants to close the eyes
And take a trip around the sun

Headed to the Northern Lights
The night has just begun
And we'll only wants to close the eyes
And take a trip around the sun
