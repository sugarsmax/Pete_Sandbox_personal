The dust that blinds me
The thrust inside me
As the devil rides within
But I stand quietly
My enemy beside me
Waiting for it all to begin
Waiting for it all to begin
The demons, they seduce me
The risk that drives me
As the angles avoid the sin
I stand quietly
My enemy beside me
Waiting for something to win
Waiting for something to win
You can run
But the ghosts are gonna come
You can hide
But the ghosts are gonna get you on the inside
You can run
But the ghosts are gonna come
You can hide
But the ghosts are gonna getcha on the inside, inside...
The dark consumes me
The (unintelligible) feeds me
As demons fight to get in
But I stand quietly
My enemy beside me
Waiting for it all to begin
Waiting for it all to begin
Waiting for it all...
Waiting for it all to kick in
Waiting for it all...
Waiting for it all to kick in
Waiting for it all...
You can run
But the ghosts are gonna come
You can hide
But the ghosts are gonna get you on the inside
Inside...
You can run
But the ghosts are gonna get you on the inside
You can hide
But the ghosts are gonna get you on the inside
Inside...
You can run
But the ghosts are gonna get you on the inside
You can hide
But the ghosts are gonna get you on the inside
You better run
The ghosts are gonna come
You better hide
They'll get you on the inside
You better run
The ghosts are gonna come
You better hide
They'll get you on the inside
You can run
But the ghosts are gonna get you on the inside
You can hide
But the ghosts are gonna get you on the inside...
