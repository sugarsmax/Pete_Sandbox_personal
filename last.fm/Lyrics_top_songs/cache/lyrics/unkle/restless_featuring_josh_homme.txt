Well, I'm all restless but I don't care
You don't like me much, well, me neither
You go read my mind like some kind of God
You live, let's have you trippin' on the same one you lost
And you
Are on me
I'm in you
You're on me
Got this sinking feeling I sank with the tulip
There ain't no habit that I would not defend
Let's come back, well, I don't resend
And I'm broken house, break you, you on the mend
When you
You're on me
Those who pay will just pay it again
It's ever beginning, that's a duel to the end
Let's rip me from the breakage and solvents
Taking over, I'll just take what you got
When you
You're on me
I'm in you
You're on me
You're the truth
I do believe
I'm in you
You're on me
Easy
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow, gonna follow
Gonna follow the light to the love
Well, I've gone restless, well, I don't care
I got fifteen bucks of savoir faire
You wanna step in my way to step it again
I never break it, I just bend it and I resend
And you
You're on me
I'm in you
You're on me
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow, follow
The light to the love
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow the light to the love
Gonna follow, gonna follow
Follow the light to the love
And you
