Wake up, young man, it's time to wake up
Your love affair has got to go
For ten long years
For ten long years, the leaves to rake up
Slow suicide's no way to go
Uh

Blue clouded gray, you're not a crack-up
Dizzy and weakened by the haze
Movin' onward
So an infection, not a phase!
Yeah-oh!


The cracks and lines from where you gave up
They make an easy man to read
Oh-oh, oh-oh
For all the times you let them bleed you
For a little peace from God you plead
And beg
For a little peace from God you plead!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-oh-oh-oh


Wake up, young man
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up
Oh yeah

Wake up, young man, it's time to wake up
Your love affair has got to go, yeah, for ten long years
For ten long years, the leaves to rake up
Slow suicide's no way to go-oh
Oh-oh
Slow suicide's no way to go

Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
