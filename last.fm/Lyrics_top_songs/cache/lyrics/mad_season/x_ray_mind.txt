Do the laughs die when
One such as I run
And allow myself
Time for own true need
When convincing me
That you're on my team
May not lie to me
But not mentionin'

So sit back and have
An hysterical
Laugh at tiny holes
Buy and trade men's souls

X-ray mind reads
Plenty
Worth no more than
Pennies

You, they, it, or what
Have been fair, I thought
May you never free
You from you or me
See, the more I think
I'm afraid to blink
I don't move an inch
Slowly draining me

Hire a spy and
Bug me
Pimp your friends for
Money
Rich and growing
Sicker
Sell the dead ones
Quicker
