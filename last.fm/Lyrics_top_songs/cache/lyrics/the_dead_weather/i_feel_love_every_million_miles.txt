Nothing to color
I cross the desert
Nothing's alive
What does the blacktop
Know that I have not cracked
With my mind?
Nothing to color
Grey as a pill
Nobody cry
Why do the street lamps
Shine on still?
Nothing's alive

I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while
I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while
Nothing to color
I cross the desert
Nothing's alive
What does the blacktop
Know that I have not cracked
With my mind?
Nothing to color
Grey as a pill
Deep in the eyes
Why do the street lamps
Shine on still
When nothing's alive?

I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while
I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while

Why does my heartbeat
Feel like a speaker
Feeding back?
Repeater, repeater

Why does my heartbeat
Feel like a speaker
Feeding back?
Repeater, repeater

Why does my heartbeat
Feel like a speaker
Feeding back?
Repeater, repeater

Why does my heartbeat
Feel like a speaker
Feeding back?
Repeater, repeater

I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while
I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while
