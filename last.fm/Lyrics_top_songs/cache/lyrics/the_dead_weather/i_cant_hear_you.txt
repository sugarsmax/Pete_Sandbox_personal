I can't hear you
You're talking to yourself
And what you're used to
Don't work on no one else

I'm gonna teach you
And keep you for myself
I'm gonna take you by the hand
I'm gonna walk you to my house
So I can hear you

Look up, say so
Naive, be so naive
You're stashing money
And rubies up your sleeve

I'm gonna teach you
You're never gonna leave
I'm gonna make you understand
There's nobody you can trust but me


I can't hear you
You're talking to yourself
And what you're used to
Don't work on no one else

Im gonna teach you
Keep you for myself
I'm gonna take you by the hand
I'm gonna walk you to my house
I wanna hear you


I can't hear you
You're talking to yourself
Oh, what you're used to
Don't work on no one else

I wanna teach you
And keep you for myself
I'm gonna take you by the hand
I'm gonna walk you to my house
So I can hear you

I wanna hear you
I wanna hear you
I wanna hear you
