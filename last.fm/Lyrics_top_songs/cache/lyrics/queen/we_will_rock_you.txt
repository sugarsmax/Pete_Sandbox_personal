Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street
Gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

We will, we will rock you (Sing it, oh)
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes
Gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

We will, we will rock you, sing it
We will, we will rock you
Everybody, we will, we will rock you
Hmm, we will, we will rock you
Alright
