Beguiled..
Got me in the veil
Two wild
Pretty eyes in grey
Would I
Let you come my way
My way..
Cause when you sing my heart is weathered
Cause when you sing my heart is weathered
Cause when you sing my heart is weathered
Like the ropes that keep you tethered
I'm dripping poison from the moon
We’re sinking in a swoon
Two shadows in a naked room
We hide and loom
Healing me, protecting me
As I cling to normalcy
Beating in a harmony
Scarred by your perversity
Killing me, infecting me
Crumbling in diversity
Heal me...
Running about
On a dreamline
Down with the shine
I'm dying to see you come, you come around
Breathing aloud
Are we lonely?
Well, if only
If only we were bound on silver clouds
Healing me, protecting me
As I cling to normalcy
Beating in a harmony
Scarred by your perversity
Killing me, infecting me
Crumbling in diversity
Heal me...
Twining a streak
From the dark light
Breaking the night
That's how your voice is sleek, your flesh is weak
Running around
Are we lonely?
Well, if only
If only we were found on a silver cloud
