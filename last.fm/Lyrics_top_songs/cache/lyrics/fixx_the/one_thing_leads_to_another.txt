The deception with tact
Just what are you trying to say?
You got a blank face, which irritates
Communicate, pull out your party piece
You see dimensions in two
State your case with black or white
But when one little cross leads to shots, grit your teeth
You run for cover, so discreet

Why don't they do what they say? Say what you mean
Oh, baby, one thing leads to another
You told me something wrong, I know I listened too long
But then one thing leads to another

The impression that you sell
Passes in and out like a scent
But the long face that you see
Comes from living close to your fears
If this is up, then I'm up
But you're running out of sight
You've seen your name on the walls
And when one little bump leads to shock, miss a beat
You run for cover in this heat

Why don't they do what they say, say what they mean?
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong, I know I listened too long
But then one thing leads to another, yeah, yeah, yeah

One thing (One, one thing) leads to another

But it's easy to believe
Somebody's been lying to me
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear
I know you've been lying to me
It's getting rough, off the cuff,  I've got to say enough's enough
Bigger, the harder he falls
But when the wrong antidote is like a bulge in the throat
You run for cover in the heat

Why don't they do what they say, say what they mean?
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong, I know I listened too long
But then one thing leads to another, yeah, yeah

One thing (One, one thing) leads to another (One thing) (Another)
One thing (One, one thing) leads to another (One thing) (Another)
One thing (One, one thing) leads to another  (One thing) (Another)
One thing leads to another
One thing (One, one thing) leads to another (One thing) (Another)
One thing (One, one thing) leads to another (One thing) (Another)
One thing (One, one thing) leads to another (One thing) (Another)
One thing leads to another
One thing (One, one thing)
