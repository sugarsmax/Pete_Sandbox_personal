Some friends of mine, just the other night
Went to hear this cool cat blow
They say he sang so good that the roof fell in
And he didn't even stop the show
They don't remember the place, but they remember the face
And now everybody wanna go, woo!

Top Jimmy cooks
Top Jimmy swings
He's got the look, ooh
Top Jimmy, he's the king

Jimmy on the television, famous people laughing with him
Jimmy on the news at five
Jimmy on the radio and even on the video
The baddest cat alive
Driving all the women crazy, all they want is Jimmy-baby
Love it when he rolls his eyes

Top Jimmy cooks
Top Jimmy swings
He's got the look
Top Jimmy, woo, shake it, baby!

Oh!

Juke-joint Jimmy is the latest thing
He's got the sound that everybody digs
And the joint be jumpin' when the band be bumpin'
And you know they're playing crazy gigs
Well, you ain't been living 'til you've seen the living end
Top Jimmy and his Rhythm Pigs

Top Jimmy cooks
Top Jimmy swings
He's got the look
Top Jimmy, oh, Jimmy
Top Jimmy, go, Jimmy
Top Jimmy
Oh, he's the king

Oh, Jimmy
