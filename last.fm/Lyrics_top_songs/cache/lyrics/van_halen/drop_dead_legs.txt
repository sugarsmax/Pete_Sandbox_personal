Ow!

Drop dead legs, pretty smile
Hurts my head, gets me wild
Dig that steam
Giant butt
Makes me scream
I get nothing, nothing but the shakes over you
And nothing else could ever do

(You know that you want it) Woo
I know what you need
(You know that you want it) Baby
(When the night is through, will I still be loving you?) Woo

Dig those moves, vampire
Set me loose, get it higher
Throw my rope, loop-de-loop
Nice white teeth, Betty Boop
Set it cool, real heavy
I ain't fooled, gettin' ready
Ooh, aw, baby

(You know that you want it) Oh, oh, oh
I know what you need
Ooh! (You know that you want it) Baby
(When the night is through) Ow! (Will I still be loving you?) Uh
