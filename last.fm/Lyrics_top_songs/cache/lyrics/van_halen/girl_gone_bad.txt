Ah, lazy eyes in the summer heat
Fresh from out of town
Now she's working on the street
Shakin' poor boys down

Ooh (Girl) ooh, girl gone bad, yeah
(Girl) Girl gone bad

Found that girl with a lonesome John
But she should've been with me
Guess that woman fall in love
She don't work for free

(Girl) Girl gone bad, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ahh
Ooh-oh

Mm-oh
Mm-oh, mm-oh, mm-oh
Oh
Mm
These streets are in ashes
I don't call them my own
Ah

(Girl) Girl gone bad
Oh (Girl), girl, girl gone bad
(Girl) Ow! Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh!
(Girl) Ooh-oh! Woah, woah!
(Girl) Yeah! Ahh
(Girl) Shake! Shake! Ooh!
