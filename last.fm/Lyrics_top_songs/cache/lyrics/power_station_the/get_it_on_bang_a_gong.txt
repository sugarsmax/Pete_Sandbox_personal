Well, you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black, don't look back, and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh, yeah
Well, you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of the hydra upon you
You're dirty, sweet, and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Dah!

Well, you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're built like a car, oh, yeah
Well you're an untamed youth
That's the truth with your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty, sweet, and you're my girl

You've got the blues in your shoes and your stockings
You're windy and wild, oh, yeah
Well, you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're dirty, sweet, and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
