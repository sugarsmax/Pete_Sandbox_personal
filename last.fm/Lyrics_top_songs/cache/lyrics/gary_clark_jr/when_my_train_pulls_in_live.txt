Everyday nothing seems to change
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old things
And I, I can't take it no more
I would leave this town
But I ain't got nowhere else to go now
Wake up in the morning to more, more bad news
Sometimes I feel like I was born to lose
And I, it's driving me out of my mind, yeah
Gonna catch the next train
And I'll move on down the line

Well I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
Well I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long
And I, I can't live this life again


Walking down the street, you might wanna cross a smiling face
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn, walk away, and I
Oh Lord, it's bringing me down, yeah
If things don't change around here
Ain't no use in me hanging 'round

Well I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
Well I'll be ready now, yeah, yeah
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long
And I, I can't live this life, oh no
