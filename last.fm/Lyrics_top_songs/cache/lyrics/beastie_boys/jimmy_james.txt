This next one is the first song on our new album

People, how you doin'? There's a new day dawnin'
For the Earth Mother, it's a brand new mornin'
For such a long while, there's been such a longin'
But now the sun is shinin', let's roll back the awnin'

Mo-mo-mo
Mo-mo-mo
Mo-mo-mo-mo
Move your body

This a type of kinda like a formal dedication
Givin' out a shout for much inspiration
All I ever really want to do is get nice
Get loose and goof a little slice of life
Sendin' out love to all corners of the land
I jump up on the stage and take the mic in my hand
I'm not playin' the role, just being who I am
And if you try to diss me, I couldn't give a damn

'Cause I'm rockin'
Rockin'
Rockin', rock-rock
Rockin', yeah, get down
Rock-rock, rock on
Rock-rock, rock on
Rock-rock, rock on
Mic-mic, mic control
Mic-mic, mic control
Mic-mic-mic, mic control
Yeah, can you get my drift?
Can you?

Bass from the back of my car feels soothin'
Eight bazookas is what I'm usin'
I'm Mike D, and it's been proven
I love it when I see the party people just movin'
Strapped on my ear goggles and what did I see?
But the music brought the people into harmony

For the blacks, Puerto Ricans, and the white people too
