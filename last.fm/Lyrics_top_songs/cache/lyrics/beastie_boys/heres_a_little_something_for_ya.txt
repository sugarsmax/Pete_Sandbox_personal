Yes, yes, yes
Ill out the gate, I set it off
I suppose you're exposed, so get lost
You break off, cut all connections
Join the sucker emcee witness protection
Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-MIKE D!
Slip off my lows in the place to be
Always on time so I never botch
The tick to the tock of the Mike D watch
Now here's a little somethin for ya
I'ma grab a little and store yah
Do some balancin' for ya
And if you feelin' chilly I'ma get you a shawl
Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Cause I ain't done yet, done yet, done yet
Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Here's a little somethin for ya
Honest Mike, what? Honest Mike D
Don't really get in the press like Z
Cause I speak my conscience and speak my mind
Don't trip and flip and then I stop to find
Queens up front, Brooklyn's in the back
Laugh and crack guns while squads smokin' crack
The odds are stacked for those who lack
Been a lucky motherfucker when it comes to that
I slow roast, I'm steady tappin'
Oh yes, I guess I'm the toast of Manhattan
In Miami, I'm sleazy with John Salley
Shout to Andre, Lee on Tally
Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Cause I ain't done yet, done yet, done yet
Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Here's a little somethin for ya
This shit is crazy
This shit is cra-zyyyy! (DING)
Dr. Karl to proceed, a/k/a Jewish
Dr. Bombay is the ladies choice
Step on stage so we smoke and dry moist
Every time I bring it twoice as noice
Now he's a breddern, take an Excedrin
Aldermen check your rhymers Tippy Hedrin
I'm undefined, I'm gettin much finer
Steady loungin in my La-Z-Boy recliner
Bruisin' and jabbin', amped up on coffee
Like kids goin wild at the sight of Mr. Softee
I smash around the corner (GASP) and sneakin up
When you're breathin down your neck (GASP) just keepin up
Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Cause I ain't done yet, done yet, done yet
Get ready, get set (get set, get set)
Place your bet (your bet, your bet)
What you get (you get, you get)
Here's a little somethin for ya
