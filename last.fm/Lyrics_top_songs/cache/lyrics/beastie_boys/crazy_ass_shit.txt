On and on to the break of dawn
On and on to the break of dawn
On and on to the break of dawn
On and on to the break of dawn
Now let me introduce myself, I'm Adrock
No matter what you order, well, I got it in stock
The doody rhyme thing, well, we got it on lock
Top off the look with the Argyle sock
Take it from me now, I'm gonna give it all I got
I take a licking, still tick-tick-tock
Smoked salmon, ain't old school lox
I go to Peter Brady and I buy Greg's sox
It's Mike on the mic and I'm known to please
Stinky nasty like the head cheese
Caps, gowns, honorary degrees
Rhymes fresh pressed like '83 Lees
You can't stop, you got to keep on
Keep on
You can't stop, you got to keep on
I mean that's all I got, except I've just got...
Even Michael Diamond him never learn
Atop him head, him have a curly perm
Tissue up my nose and my dick's in a cast
I don't wanna talk about it, past is past
All you crusty punks that are into Crass
Go and take a shower and wash that ass
We rock nonstop here in New York City
Sweet on the mic, looking so damn pretty
Served by me, well, it must feel shitty
Weird thing to say here, it goes tough titty
I've got rhymes in a pitcher and it's time to pour
I'm at the tee and I'm screaming "Fore!"
Hit into your party as I declare war
Roberta Peterson's got a spine like a dinosaur
You can't stop, you got to keep on
Keep on
You can't stop, you got to keep on
Keep on
You can't stop, you got to keep on
On and on to the break of dawn
Brass monkey, you're the funky
Brass monkey, you're the funky
Brass monkey, you're the funky
Brass monkey, you're the funky monkey
