Say it!
MCA:
To the heart of the matter, the mic I shatter
So cold on the mic, I make your teeth chatter
You climb the corporate ladder
To make your pockets fatter
We be flipping styles like pancake batter
Mike D:
Looking through your binos, spying on me
I'm running like a rhino on a drinking spree
Call yourself an MC, but what's your truth?
You Gotta let it loose inside the toll booth
Ad-Rock:
Suckers sniffin' on socks, chewin' on rocks
My competition want the combination to the lock
You wanna get inside, well, then you best knock-knock
And when you get on, you got to rock nonstop
Beastie Boys:
Once it hits your mind, what'cha gonna do?
Don't keep it inside, you've got to
Say it!
Let it out, let it out
Scream it!
Gonna shout, gonna shout
Write it!
Gotta put it out, put it out
Say it!
Gotta get it out, get it out
Watch out, come again now, sucker
Yaaa...
MCA:
Well, I can feel it in my bloodstream, see it in their eyes
People lining up for their own demise
To help the man make weapons to monetize
Corporate violence, we can't abide
Mike D:
You can keep your bottle service and your cabana
Bust your ass drunk like you slipped on a banana
Like knick-knack, patty whack, you've got to let it out
From the mind to the mic, to the word to a shout
Ad-Rock
Mind to the rhyme, paper to the pen
The brand new dance called the David Rodigan
You sure you really wanna let me begin
You can't stop me rhymin' when I'm on, I'm all in
Beastie Boys:
Life is good and then it gets you
Stuff you thought, it comes true
Once it hits your mind, what'cha gonna do?
Don't keep it inside, you've got to
Say it!
Let it out, let it out
Scream it!
Gonna shout, gonna shout
Write it!
Gotta put it out, put it out
Say it!
Gotta get it out, get it out
Watch out, come again now, sucker
Watch out, come again now, sucker (Uh, suckers)
Watch out, come again now, sucker
Watch out, come again now, sucker (Uh, suckers)
