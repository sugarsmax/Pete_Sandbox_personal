I turn my camera on
I cut my fingers on the way
On the way
The way I'm slippin' away
I turn my feelings off
You made me untouchable for life, yeah
And you wasn't polite
It hit me like a tom
You hit me like a tom
Ooh no, no, no no
Ooh yeah
When I turn my feelings on
I turn my feelings on inside, yeah yeah
Feel like I'm gonna ignite
I saw them stars go off
I saw them stars go off at night, ooh yeah
And they're looking alright
Keep on blowin' up
Keep on blowin' em off
Get up, roll it out
Keep on showin' 'em out
You hit me like a tom
It hit me like a tom
On and on a tom
I turn my camera on
I cut my fingers on the way
On the way (on the way)
I feel me slippin' away
I wipe my feelings off
You made me untouchable for life (keep on blowin' up, keep on blowin' em off)
Ooh yeah, and you wasn't polite
You hit me like a tom
I don't know where it's from
It hit me like a tom (tom)
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah (I turn my camera on)
Ooh yeah (I turn my camera on)
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
I turn my camera on (hit me like a tom)
I turn my camera on (hit me like a tom)
I turn my camera on (hit me like a tom)
I turn my camera on (hit me like a tom)
Feel me slip away
