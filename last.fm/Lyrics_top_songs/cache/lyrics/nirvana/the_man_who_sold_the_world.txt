OK, that's where I'm having trouble, because...
No, let's just do it once, because...
The problem that I'm having is that I'm so used to going all the way through and then starting by myself
Okay, so we do it once before you start singing?
The problem is that I'm just not used to hearing Pat do that one chord thing
One more time
(Oops)

We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
Made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
For all the millions here
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world


Okay, that's—that's perfect
