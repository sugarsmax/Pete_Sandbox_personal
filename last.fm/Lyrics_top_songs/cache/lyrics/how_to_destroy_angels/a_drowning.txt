It's the glare from the reflection
Making patterns in your eye
It's the looking back in anger
With every second slipping by
Undertow has come to take me
Guided by the blazing sun
Look at everything around us
Well, look at everything we've done

Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here
Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here
Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here
Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself


There's a tiny little window
Swarms of locusts fill the sky
Maybe I just disappear
If I can keep my head above the tide

Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here
Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here
Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
I'm drowning here
Please, anyone
I don't think I can save myself
