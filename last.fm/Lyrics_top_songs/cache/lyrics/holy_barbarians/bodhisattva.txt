I love my summer girl naked on my skin
Take me down to your dandelion fields
Roll me around in your dirty little fields
I love my summer girl flower on my skin
Take me down to your dandelion fields
Roll me around in your dirty little fields
Enlighten me now let's get naked in the wind
Bodhisattva please kiss me bodhisattva don't judge me
Getting high on a drop of wine kerouac is doing fine
Bodhisattva please bless me bodhisattva please kiss me
Bodhisattva give me time yeah i'll climb annapurna
Baby aphrodisiac on my back
Shave my head and get a holy book
Shave my little head and get a holy book
Baby aphrodisiac on my back
Punt in around the western world
Telling lies to boys and girls
Ginsberg zen punk beat
