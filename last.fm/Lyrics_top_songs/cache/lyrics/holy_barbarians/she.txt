She she's like a tiger gone she is like a loaded gun
She she's the kind of girl
She she's the kind of girl
She upset my little world and she is a naughty little girl girl girl
She is like a tiger gone she's an exploding sun
She she's the kind of girl she's my kind of woman she's my kind of girl
She she's the kind of girl she's my kind of woman she's my kind of girl
She's the kind of girl destroys my little world she's my kind of woman she's my kind of girl
She's the kind of girl destroys my little world she's my kind of woman she's my kind of girl
