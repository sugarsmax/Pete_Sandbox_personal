I want to live in a city where the air is clean
Well where the people laugh all day and share their dreams
I can't hold back the tears of all the things i've seen
Like endless waves on an empty beach
Why are you shouting? you know i can hear you hear you brother is fighting my sister is crying
Why are you shouting? you know i can hear you hear you brother is fighting while my sister she's crying
White knuckle uncle makes his violence known
To the little man well who has no throne
Rip out his lion's heart implant a stone
If you give in now well you'll be left alone
