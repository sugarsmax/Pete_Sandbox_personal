So you never knew love until you crossed the line of grace
And you never felt wanted till you'd someone slap your face
So you never felt alive until you'd almost wasted away

You had to win, you couldn't just pass
The smartest ass at the top of the class
Your flying colours, your family tree
And all your lessons in history

Please, please, please
Get up off your knees
Please, please, please
Please, oh yeah

So you never knew how low you'd stoop to make that call
And you never knew what was on the ground till they made you crawl
So you never knew that the heaven you keep you stole

Your Catholic blues, your convent shoes
Your stick-on tattoos now they're making the news
Your holy war, your northern star
Your sermon on the mount from the boot of your car

Please, please, please
Get up off your knees now
Please, please, please
Leave me out of this, please

So love is hard
And love is tough
But love is not
What you're thinking of

September, streets capsizing
Spilling over down the drains
Shards of glass splinters like rain
But you could only feel your own pain
October, talk getting nowhere
November, December, remember
We just started again

Please, please, please
Get up off your knees, yeah
Please, please, please
Please, ah

So love is big
Is bigger than us
But love is not
What you're thinking of

It's what lovers deal
It's what lovers steal
You know I've found it hard to receive
'Cause you, my love
I could never believe
