Lean forward slightly, look straight at the speaker
And listen with a sparkle in your eye
As though you might be thinking
"Gee, this is the most wonderful thing I've ever heard in all my life'"

Back in the day
We were eye to eye
The thought of you
Had me running wild
They say love lost will never grow
But hey, hey, hey, I still love you so

Oh, when we met
You know the sun did shine
From your eyes
Back into mine
Oh if the sun is shine no more
Well hey, hey, hey, I still love you so

I'll beg the moon
And the stars above
Bring me back my–
That gal I love
I know you're gone, you're gone for sure
But hey, hey, hey, I still love you so
