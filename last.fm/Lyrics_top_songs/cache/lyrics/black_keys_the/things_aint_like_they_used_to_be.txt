I went around the way for you
Did all those things you asked me to
I thought it was the perfect day
'Til she just opened up to say

"It doesn't mean a thing to me"
"It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
Things ain't like they used to be"

I headed out to Lester Hill
But that just made me weaker still
She's got the kind of love I need
The kind that's never good on me

It doesn't mean a thing to me
It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
Things ain't like they used to be


Walked into the battle blind
It happens almost all the time
The yard is kind of overgrown
And all those happy times are gone

It doesn't mean a thing to me
It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
That things ain't like they used to be
It doesn't mean a thing to me (No!)
It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
Things ain't like they used to be
