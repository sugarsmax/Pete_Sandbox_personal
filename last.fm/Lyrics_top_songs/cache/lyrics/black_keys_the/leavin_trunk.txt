Going upstairs to pack my leavin' trunk
I ain't seen no whiskey
Woman made me sloppy
Seen no whiskey
Woman made me drunk
Going back home
Where I had much better luck

Look here darlin'
Want me to be your king
Said you're kidding darlin'
Got to keep it hid
Don't let your main man
Your husband catch me here
Don't let your main man
Your husband catch me here
