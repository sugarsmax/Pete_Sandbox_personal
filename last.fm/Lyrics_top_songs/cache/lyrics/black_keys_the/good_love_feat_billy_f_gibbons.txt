Good loving is so hard to find
Everybody wanna waste your time
Waste your time, yours and mine
A good love is hard to find

Good loving is so hard to feel
You got nothing 'til you find the real deal
Find the real, there it is
A good love is hard to feel


Don't you rush it, gotta take it slow
You can't listen to the friends you know
'Cause they don't know what you know
But good love is hard to know
