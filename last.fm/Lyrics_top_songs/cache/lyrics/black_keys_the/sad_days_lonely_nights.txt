My mama told me
When I was a child
She said, "Son, gonna have hard days"
My daddy told me too
He said, "Son, gonna have sad days, lonely nights"
Sittin' alone, head hung down
Tears runnin' down
Sad days, lonely nights
Done overtaken me

Sometimes I sit alone
I wonder about things
My mama and daddy told me
Sad days, lonely nights
Done overtaken me

Sometimes I sit alone
And I wonder about things
My mama and daddy told me
Sad days, lonely nights
Done overtaken me
