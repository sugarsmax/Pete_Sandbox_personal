I said, Louise
The sweetest girl
I said, Louise
The sweetest girl
She called me to warm Chicago
Down the Gulf of Mexico

Now look here, Louise, you know you got to
To be your kin
Came right over and you wanna
Keep it hid, oh, Louise
The sweetest
She called me to warm Chicago
Down the gulf

Now look here, Louise, you know I don't
Be your kin
No, you came right over
Keep it hid
Oh, Louise, the sweet
She called me to warm Chicago
Now I’m goin'

Fade out on that?
Yeah
