Poor black Mattie ain't got
Change in clothes
Fool got drunk, close that door
Coal black Mattie
Ain't got change in clothes

Goin' to Memphis, see that world fair
Reason I'm going
'Cause my baby's there
Goin' to Memphis
See that world fair

Need no heater fireplace by my bed
Woman I got
Cherry red
Need no heater
Fireplace by my bed

Poor black Mattie ain't got change in clothes
Fool got drunk, close that door
Coal black Mattie
Ain't got change in clothes
