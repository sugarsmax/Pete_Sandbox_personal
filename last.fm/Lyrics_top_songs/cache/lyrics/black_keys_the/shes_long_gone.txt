Yeah

She was made to blow you away
She don't care what any man say
Well you can watch her strut, but keep your mouth shut
Or it's ruination day

Well now she's long
A-long gone
Oh now she's long
Yeah, now she's long gone like Moses through the corn

Well her eyes, they're rubies and pearls
And she's not made like those other girls
Well, her lashes flap and they smack men back
Like springs bouncing off of her curls

Oh now she's long
A-long gone
Na-na-na-na now she's long
A-long gone like Moses through the corn
Oh, rock on
