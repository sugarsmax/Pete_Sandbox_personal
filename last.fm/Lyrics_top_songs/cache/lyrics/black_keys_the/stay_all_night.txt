Stay all night
Stay a little longer
Pull off your clothes
And throw 'em in the corner
And love me, girl
Love me, baby
Love me, babe
Love me, babe

Girl I love
Girl I need
Be here, babe
Hold me tight
And love me, girl
Love me, babe
Love me, baby
Love me, babe

Girl, I love you
Girl I need
Be here, babe
Hold me tight
And love me, girl
Love me, babe
Love me, babe
Love me, babe

Girl, I love you
Girl I need
Be here, babe
And hold me tight
And love me, girl
Love me, babe
Love me, babe
Love me, babe

Stay all night
Stay a little longer
Pull off your clothes
And throw 'em in the corner
And love me, girl
Love me, baby
Love me, babe
Love me, babe
