Poor boy, I'm a long way from home
Poor boy, I’m a long way from home
Poor boy, I'm a long way from home
World gonna do me no

Babe, I can't stay here long
No, no, no
Poor boy, I’m a long way from home
Where the world can't do me no

Poor boy, I'm a long way from home
Poor boy, I'm a long way from home
Poor boy, I'm a long way from home
Where the world can't do me no
