It don't matter where ya been
The people try to do you in
Every day 'til dawn
There's some thievin' goin' on

Oh! Oh no
Hurt me so

Just the same old thing
Just the same old thing
No matter how much love you try to bring
Just the same old thing

You got a callous heart
From being torn apart
Now you labor every day
Love life drifts away

Oh! Oh no
It hurts me so

Just the same old thing
Just the same old thing
No matter how much love you try to bring, yeah
Just the same old thing, yeah
