I'm going down south, I'm going down south
Going down south, I'm going down south
Chilly wind don't blow

I'm going with you, babe, I'm going with you, babe
Going with you, babe, I'm going with you, babe
Don't care where you go

Some other man, some other man
Some other man, some other man
He's always hanging around

I'd rather be dead, rather be dead
Rather be dead, I'd rather be dead
Six feet in the ground

I'm going down south, going down south
Going down south, I'm going down south
Chilly wind don't blow
