Very superstitious, writing's on the wall
Very superstitious, ladder's about to fall
Thirteen-month-old baby broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in the past

When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you gonna suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Hey-ey, hey

Very superstitious, shoes on table top
Very superstitious, we were all mixed up
Walking over broomsticks lying on the floor
Don't open your umbrella till you're out the door

To be ruled by things that you don't understand
You're gonna suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Hey-ey, hey
