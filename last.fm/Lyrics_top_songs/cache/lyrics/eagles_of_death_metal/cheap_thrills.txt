Can't afford no
(Cheap thrills)
(Whatcha doin'?)
I'm spendin time
(Whatcha doin'?)
Got my last dime
(Catch a fast babe)
I'm gonna try
(Catch a fast babe)
I'm gonna try
I see red
When my back's against the wall
I see red
Like the ocean when it's standing at the end
Of what your looking for
I see red
And that's all
(Whatcha doin'?)
I'm spending time
(Whatcha doin'?)
Got my last dime
(Catch a fast babe)
I'm on the sly
(Catch a fast babe)
I'm gonna try
Can't afford no
(Cheap thrills)
