Palm trees and fun
And fabulous sun
Hollywood's always like that
But nothing is real
Even what you can feel
Is just illusion
Suddenly you appear
Out of the smoke and haze
And I think that you got me
Falling for you
I think that you got me
The moment of fun
Glows like the sun
I'm telling my friends about you
Not to say you're the one
But I put down my guns
Then you went Hollywood on me
Now I'm a fool
I feel like the whole world knows
And I just can't escape it
Figured you're cool
I was so sweet on you
And it seems like you faked it
Seems sort of cruel
I think I can shake you off
Yeah I'm tough, I can take it
But telling you true
You coulda been good on me...
