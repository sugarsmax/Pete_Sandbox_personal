You didn't want to scratch but then you got the itch
You only wanted Snow White but you got the witch
You know you're always paying for the shit that's free
It's not easy with this complexity
I tried to make it easy never stop the flow
Just keep it sweet and simple, let a little skin show
My socks and underwear, I like to keep them clean
It's so easy without complexity
You say you want to finish but you never start
You want to get it finished but you just try hard
It don't take nothing fancy, it's just ABCs
It so easy without complexity
You want the good stuff, you want the big hit
The path that's simple, not complicated
'Cause if you close your eyes then you won't see
That it's easier without complexity
Too broke to pay attention, better get you some
When trouble's up, I double up on bubble gum
I like to strut my stuffing down on Easy Street
So completely without complexity
I tried to make it easy, never stop the flow
Just keep it sweet and simple, let a little skin show
My socks and underwear, I like to keep them clean
It's so easy without complexity
You want the good stuff, you want the big hit
The path that's simple, not complicated
'Cause if you close your eyes then you won't see
That it's easier without complexity
You want the good stuff, you want the big hit
The path that's simple, not complicated
'Cause if you close your eyes then you won't see
That it's easier without complexity
