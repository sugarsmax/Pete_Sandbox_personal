Dogs on the loose, tryin' to call my name
Look like the tongue of the monkey done licked your brain
Move it to the left, shake it to the right
Make some room for your daddy cause he gonna make a landing tonight
Scratch like a cat and bark like a bitch
To let me know that you're mine
You're mine
You're mine
Scratch like a cat and bark like a bitch
I don't care what the people say
They don't know what they missin'
Off with your head
Off with the light
Give me some head and a light, then I guess it's goodnight
Scratch like a cat and bark like a bitch
Well I guess it's goodnight
Scratch like a cat and bark like a bitch
