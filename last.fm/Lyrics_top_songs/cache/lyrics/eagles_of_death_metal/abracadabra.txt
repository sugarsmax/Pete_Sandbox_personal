I heat up, I can't cool down
Got me spinnin' 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me, baby, let the fire get higher
Abra-abracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abracadabra
Abracadabra
You make me hot, you make me sigh
You make me laugh, you make me cry
Keep me burnin' for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove
Abra-abracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abracadabra
Abracadabra
I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin, leather and lacе
Black panties with an angel's face
I see magic in your еyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say
Abra-abracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abracadabra
Abracadabra
Every time you call my name (Every time)
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me, baby, let the fire get higher
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round and
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round and
I heat up, I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round and
