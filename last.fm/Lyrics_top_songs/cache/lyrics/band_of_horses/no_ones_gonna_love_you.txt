It's looking like a limb torn off
Or all together, just taken apart
A-reelin' through an endless fall
We are the ever-living ghost of what once was

But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

And anything to make you smile
It is a better side of you to admire
But they should never take so long
Just to be over, then back to another one

And no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

And someone, they could've warned you
When things start splittin' at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumblin' down
Things start splittin' at the seams and now
If things start splittin' at the seams and now
It's tumblin' down hard

Yeah, anything to make you smile
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was
They never want to hear you say
That you'd be better off, or you liked it that way

And no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

But someone, they should've warned you
If things start splittin' at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumblin' down
Things start splittin' at the seams and now
If things start splittin' at the seams and now
It's tumblin' down hard
