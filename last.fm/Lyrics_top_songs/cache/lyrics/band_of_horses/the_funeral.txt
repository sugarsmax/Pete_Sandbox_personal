I'm coming up only to hold you under
And coming up only to show you wrong
And to know you is hard, we wonder
To know you all wrong, we won

Ooh
Ooh

Really too late to call, so we wait for
Morning to wake you is all we got
But to know me as hardly golden
Is to know me all wrong, they won

At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion of one billion day funeral

I'm coming up only to show you down for
And coming up only to show you wrong
To the outside, the dead leaves they own the lawn
'Fore they died and had trees to hang there upon

Ooh
Ooh

At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion of one billion day funeral
