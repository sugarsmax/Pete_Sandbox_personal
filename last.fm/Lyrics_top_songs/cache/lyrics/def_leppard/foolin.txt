Lady luck never smiles
So lend your love to me awhile
Do with me what you will
Break the spell, take your fill
On and on, we rode the storm
The flame has died and the fire has gone
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone
I realized that long ago

Is anybody out there?
Anybody there?
Does anybody wonder?
Anybody care?

Oh, I just got to know
If you're really there
And you really care
Because baby, I'm not
F-f-f-foolin'
Ah, f-f-foolin'
F-f-f-fooling
Ah, f-f-fooling

Won't you stay with me a while? Oh, whoa, ho
Close your eyes don't run and hide
Easy love is no easy ride
Just waking up from what we had
Could stop good love from going bad

Is anybody out there?
Anybody there?
Does anybody wonder?
Anybody care?

Oh, I just got to know
If you're really there
And you really care
Because baby, I'm not
F-f-f-foolin'
Ah, f-f-foolin'
F-f-f-fooling
Ah, f-f-fooling
Ow!

Ah, ah, ah-ow!

Oh, I just got to know
If you're really there and you really care
Because baby, I'm not
F-f-f-foolin'
Ah, f-f-foolin'
Not f-f-f-foolin'
Oh, no

I'm not foolin' myself (I'm not foolin' myself)
No-no, no (I'm not foolin' myself)
I'm not, no (I'm not foolin' myself)
I'm not foolin' (I'm not foolin' myself)
No!
