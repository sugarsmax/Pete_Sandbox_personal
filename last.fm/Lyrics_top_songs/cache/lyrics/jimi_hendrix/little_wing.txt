Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running 'round
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And-a, fairy tales
(That's all she ever thinks about)
Riding with the wind

When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
"It's alright," she said, "it's alright
Take anything you want from me"
(Dig that) "Anything"
Fly on, little wing


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing...
