You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run, tried to hide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah

We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
But can you still recall the time we cried?

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

Hey!
Come on, yeah

Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get high
She get high
She get high
She get high, yeah

I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chain us, eyes that lied

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, ow!
Oh, yeah!

Made the scene, week to week
Day to day, hour to hour
Gate is straight, deep and wide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, break on through
Break on through, break on through
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey
