You don't know what love is baby
You've been runnin' my heart with lies
Played your song and then you were gone
Like the beat goes out at night
You don't know what love is baby
And you're runnin' it outta time
When you wake it'll be too late
I'll have danced you out my life
I'll be dancin', you'll be wishin'
You still had my love
Sweet romancin'
Just me so free
I have had enough
I'll be dancin', you'll be wishin'
You still had my love
Sweet romancin'
Just me so free
I have had enough
It ain't love
What you're doin' to me baby oh
It ain't love
That made me weak baby oh
It ain't love
That I'm dancin' free baby oh no
It ain't love
That I'm dancin' free baby
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
You don't know no no no
It ain't love
What you're doin' to me
It ain't love
That made me weak
It ain't love
That I'm dancin' free
It ain't love baby
It ain't love
What you're doin' to me
It ain't love
That made me weak
It ain't love
That I'm dancin' free
If it ain't love baby
It's not enough
