A vision of you there
Standing tall
By the gate
Everything is new
Stare into
What is not
Yet
As your bones grow
And you feel the pain
In exchange
Experiences hang
Run round your mind
And collide
Hang your toes
Over the edge
Cause you can
You can switch your place
Hide inside
If you try
You'll open up your eyes
And realize
How you fit
In the wild
A lion is a lion
No apologies
And a leash
Is a leech
In the corral
You're safe and warm
Pass it on to
Every sheep
Time and time again
You stick yourself
To accept
Someone else
Give up the wish
Let go of the dream
Barricade
Fantasy
Burn the dogma
Let the fire
Overtake
The desire
To define

(I will find a way
To keep this moment)
What's raging
(For myself I will find a way)
Out of control
Like a weed
(I will find a way)
Like a storm
(To keep this moment for myself)
Like a virus
(I will find a way)
Like an ocean
Like a silence
(I will find a way)
An emotion
(To keep this moment for myself)
Like a darkness
(I will find a way) (I will find a way)
Like a chance
An idea
(I will find a way)
Like a hurt
Like an outrage
(To keep this moment for myself)
Like a sunrise
Like a monster
(I will find a way)
Like a monster
Like a mantra
Like a mantra

(Nothing be the same)
(Nothing be the same)
(Nothing be the same)
(Nothing)
 
And all of this
Will never be the same
Again
