When you flew out of the nest
You made a mistake, flew all the way back
When you got back to your den
One minute too late was already wrecked

I,I, I,I
It's a fraction of the hope
But it's so hard to control
I,I, I,I
Get this straight

You can't, can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't, can't count on a second try
The second try will never come round

You stick to what you knew before
Don't know what you like, just made up your mind
The pictures still hangs on the wall
From back in the day when you had it all

I,I, I,I
It's a fraction of the hope
But it's so hard to control
I,I I,I
Get this straight

You can't, can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't, can't count on a second try
The second try is set to come down
You can't, can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't, can't count on a second try
The second try is set to come down

I,I, I,I
It's a fraction of the hope
But it's so hard to control
I,I, I,I
Get this straight

You can't, can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't, can't count on a second try
The second try will never come round

You can't, can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't, can't count on a second try
The second try is set to come down
