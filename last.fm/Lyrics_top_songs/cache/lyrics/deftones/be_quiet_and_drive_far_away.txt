This town don't feel mine
I'm fast to get away, far


I dressed you in her clothes
So drive me, far
Away
Away
Away


It feels good to know you're all mine
Now drive me, far
Away
Away
Away

Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care

Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
Away
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
I don't care where, just far (Away)
Away
So far (Away)
I don't care where, far (Away)
I don't care just where, far (Away)
I don't care, somewhere far (Away)
