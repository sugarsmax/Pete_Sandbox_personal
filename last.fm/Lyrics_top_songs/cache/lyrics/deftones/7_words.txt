I'll never be the same, break in decency
Don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words, got a weak self-esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us fees
Keep it all inside 'til we feel we can't unleash
But I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong

Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck with my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck it, pig

You and me out here alone
Face flat along the edge of the glass
Well, I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of that
My parents made me strong to look up that glass
So why should I try? Act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shelf
Your punk ass made it up, now your fuckin' mind is gone
Should've never glorified, now you're right

Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck with my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, bitch

Shut up, you don't know me
Shut up, you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you
Pickpocket, big fuckin' head

Well, I'll tell you about my blunt stack
What's coming back, Jack? We'll turn back
Curse, fighting their words, tell them that you fucking heard
I mean, they know that's what's coming, nigga, you quitter
I'm thinking 'bout something naughty and won't tell anybody
So, thinking of me by now, but you go grab it
I'd like to think, for who I down this shit
I belong where they be, 'cause we cannot get back those lives

Resist to cease, understand?
God hates black shades and all the clergy
Mr. P.I.G. Could I fucking see?
Shorty done crushed all of my brothers' dignity
And to the jury, carry your turns
On my skin this color, does that mean I'm burnt?
'Cause your punk ass made it up, your fuckin' mind was gone
Should've never glorified, wrong

Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck it
They fuck with my head
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, you bad boy
