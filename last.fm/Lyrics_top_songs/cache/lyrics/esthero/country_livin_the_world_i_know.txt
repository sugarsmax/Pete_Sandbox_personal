The world I know
Is a world too slow
Don't move fast enough, keep your head low
The world I know
Is a world much too slow
If you can't move fast enough, child, better stay on the low, child

And I want to lay in the passenger seat of a car
We could drive around all night
We wouldn't have to go too far
Just look at the stars
This night could be ours

The world I know
Is a world too slow
Don't move fast enough, keep your head low
The world I know
Is a world much too slow
If you can't move fast enough, child, better stay on the low, child

And I want a life lover that'll go that far
We don't have to do this right
Do you know who you are?
This ride could be ours
Just look at those stars

And we are never going home
This ride is far too long to travel alone
And the Moon will shine brightly on this road
Which way you wanna go?

The world I know
Is a world too slow
Don't move fast enough, keep your head low
The world I know
Is a world much too slow
If you can't move fast enough, child, better stay on the low, child

And I want a life-lover that'll go that far
We don't have to do this right
Yes, I know who you are
This ride could be ours
Just look at those stars
Baby, we could be stars
Just look at those stars
Baby, we could be stars
