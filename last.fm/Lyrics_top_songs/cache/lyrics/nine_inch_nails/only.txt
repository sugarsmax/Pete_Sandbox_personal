I'm becoming less defined as days go by
Fading away and well, you might say I'm losing focus
Kinda drifting into the abstract
In terms of how I see myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
(I think sometimes I can see right through myself)

Less concerned about fitting into the world
Your world, that is
'Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
(No, it doesn't really matter anymore)
No, it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore

Yes, I am alone, but, then again, I always was
As far back as I can tell, I think maybe it's because
Because you were never really real to begin with
I just made you up to hurt myself
I just made you up to hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up to hurt myself
I just made you up to hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up to hurt myself
And it worked, yes it did

There is no you, there is only me
There is no you, there is only me
There is no fuckin' you, there is only me!
There is no fuckin' you, there is only me!

Only, only
Only, only

Well, the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone, I kept pickin' at the scab
It was a doorway tryin' to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

Now I am somewhere I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
And now I know why, now, n-now I know why
Things aren't as pretty on the inside

There is no you, there is only me
There is no you, there is only me
There is no fuckin' you, there is only me!
There is no fuckin' you, there is only me!

Only, only
Only, only
Only, only
Only, only
