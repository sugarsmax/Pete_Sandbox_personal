Mama got the blues all about them
Ain't no tellin' what we's gonna do
Can't stop that feeling
It's all about to change, that's what they're sayin'
Where we gonna run to
Mama got the blues and what lord is we gonna do

Lord I got a bad old feelin'
Hummin' that old distant melody
Don't see no future
It all been a buildin' up on my shoulder
Holdin' me under
Mama got the blues and what lord is we gonna do

I don't know no way around it
Any old way I's goin' down slow
Any old way
We on our way on this long distant journey
Don't know if I'm 'on get through
Mama got the blues and what lord is we gonna do
But it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
