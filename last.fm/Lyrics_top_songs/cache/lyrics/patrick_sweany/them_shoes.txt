My mind is filled with ghosts
They're more than most of all my loves gone wrong
My mind should be the way
Most people say that I should just move on
My mind is focused on
Things past and gone when I have no control
I can't forget there used to be
I used to see but now no more
Think I'm living in a past life...
In a past life, too
It's a kind of thing that
Catches up to you
I guess I just believe that
It's the thing to do
So here's a little feedback
You gotta wear those shoes
No one said it would be easy
Sometimes it is hard to do
It isn't like the TV
You see the cold hard truth
And the things you see in movies
Just don't come true
So here's a little feedback
You gotta wear your shoes
I will live a half-life
It'll have to do
Now you can have a love life
You have loved me, too
You can see me in the evening
When the weather's cool
But here's a little feedback
You gotta wear the shoes
