I was born dead, mama told me
She said the devils, they didn't want me
And they left me behind for her to hold
And she said no one could see me
I was invisible to everybody
And we would have revenge for what they stole

She said a fire was how we'd make them pay
As I ran across the field, she would scream:

Light it up, son
Light it up, son
Light it up
Mhmm

She would send me in with the matches
I would burn that shit down to ashes
And I would crawl out of the flames back into her arms
And she was right, no one could see me
I was her ghost, I was her banshee
And in our wake, we watched Montana burn

Somehow, they figured out that it was her
But it only made us run faster

Light it up, son
Light it up, son
Light it up
Mhmm

When she was tired of the chase
She decided that we would make our peace
See I was born dead and she was jealous the whole time
So she tied us both to the stairwell
Made me light one last farewell
I can still hear her crying through the flames

And when the Helena police arrived at the scene
The fire must have burned away my invisibility
They pulled me out, not a scratch, they couldn’t believe
Just a loose rope wrapped around me not tied to anything

Light it up, son
Light it up, son
Light it up
Woah, woah
Light it up
Woah, woah
