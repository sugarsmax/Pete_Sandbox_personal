Don't turn nasty now, the dusts of Hell
A pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been 'round you've been around enough
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh

The glue won't hold, the thread unpulls
Uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
The drug that will kill you
Kill you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you

Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
