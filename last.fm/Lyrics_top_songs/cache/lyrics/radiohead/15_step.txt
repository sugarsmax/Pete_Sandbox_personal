How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out, then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

You used to be alright, what happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

You used to be alright, what happened?
Et cetera, et cetera
Fads for whatever (
Yay!
)
Fifteen steps, then a sheer drop

(
Yay! Yay!
)

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out, then you cut the string
