In the next world war, jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In a neon sign scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

In a deep, deep sleep of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car, I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe


In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
