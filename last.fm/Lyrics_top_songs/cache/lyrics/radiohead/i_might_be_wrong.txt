I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light
Coming on

I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up
Begin again

Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times
And never look back
Never look back

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?

Open up
And let me in

Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all

Come on and let me in
Come on and let me in
