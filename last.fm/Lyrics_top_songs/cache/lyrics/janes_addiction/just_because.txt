If I were you, I'd better watch out
When was the last time you did anything
Not for me or anyone else?
Just because, just because

You, oh, you really should have known
Hey you, you really should have known
Just because, just because

You got the most, oh, but nobody loves you
Nobody has to just because

You, oh, you really should have known
Oh, you, I think you really should have known
Just because, just because

Oh no
Oh, baby, watch out

When we first met and we passed around gifts
That was a long time ago, and yours didn't fit

Yeah, you, oh, you really should have known
Oh, you, oh, you really should have known
Just because, just because, just because

Oh no, now
Oh, you better watch out
