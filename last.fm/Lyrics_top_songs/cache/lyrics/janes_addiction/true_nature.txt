Here we go!

Power trippin' your luck is switched
Oh, so now it's funny
When it's your turn to laugh
Go poke the runnin' joke

Scoring points with God, get no perfect marks
Man, your grades keep falling
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling

Porn chick calls herself a therapist
Baby, call it what it is
All the money in the world
We'll go to war for backward heroes

Come to rescue you just to lean on you
With interests soaring
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling

Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Motherfucker, do-do-do-do, yeah

Please believe, we live and breathe
Through native tongue and poetry
All these years, man, we believed, yeah


Scoring points with God, get no perfect marks
And your grades keep falling
How you treat the weak is
Your true nature calling
