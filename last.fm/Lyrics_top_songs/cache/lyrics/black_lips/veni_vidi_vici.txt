Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the greatest of them all?
My man Muhammad, Boy Jesus too
Who's messiah be good for you?

Cause I came I saw
I conquered all
All y'all, all y'all, all y'all

People look towards Mecca's way
Sistine Chapel people pray
It don't matter what you do
Holy World War will come for you

Cause I came and I saw
I conquered all
All y'all, all y'all, all y'all
