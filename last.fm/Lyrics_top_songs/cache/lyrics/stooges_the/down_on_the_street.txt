Well, down on the street where the faces shine
Floatin' around on a real O-Mind
I see a pretty thing
Ain't no wall
I see a pretty thing
Ain't no wall

No wall
No wall
No wall

Yeah, deep in the night, I'm lost in love
Yeah, deep in the night, I'm lost in love
A thousand lights
Look at you
A thousand lights
Look at you

At you
At you
At you
Yeah
Come on
Come on, come on, come on
Woo

Yeah, yeah

Ooh, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Where the faces shine
A real O-Mind
A real O-Mind
I'm a real O-Mind
A real O-Mind
