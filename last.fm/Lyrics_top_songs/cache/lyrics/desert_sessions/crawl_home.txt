No more, it's done
Crawl home, get gone
Your love is evil
Lonesome
My bones

Took me such a long time to figure it out
Now is it too late? I can't do it now
Took me such a long time to figure it out
Don't take it away, oh away, oh

Snowstorm in my heart
Crawl home
Your goal is evil
I'm lonesome
Just dead moan
Where you dare

Took me such a long time to figure it out
Now is it too late? I can't do it now
Took me such a long time to figure it out
Don't take it away, oh away, oh
Took me such a long time to figure it out
Now is it too late? I can't do it now
Took me such a long time to figure it out
Don't take it away, oh away, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
