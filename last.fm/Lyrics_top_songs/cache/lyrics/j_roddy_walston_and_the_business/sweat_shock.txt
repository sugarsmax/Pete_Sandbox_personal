Oh murmur now you've gently
Oh you've been upon my mind
And you're riding on science and you're using time to bind
I'm going into sweat shock
Come and lay your hands down on the bodies of the weak
Come and press our tongues now to the words no man should speak
Black candles are your burning. Are you blown against the wind?
I've come to bear, I’ve come to bear the lower keys of Solomon
I'm going into sweat shock
