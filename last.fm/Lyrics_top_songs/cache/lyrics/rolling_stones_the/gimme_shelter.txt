Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh, a storm is threatening
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, yeah

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very streets today
Burns like a red-coal carpet
Mad bull, lost your way

War, children, yeah
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, yeah
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

[Bridge: Merry Clayton & 
Mick Jagger

Rape, murder, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder (
Whoo
), it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Yeah

Mmm, a flood is threatening
My very life today
Gimme, 
gimme shelter
Or I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you, love, sister
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away
