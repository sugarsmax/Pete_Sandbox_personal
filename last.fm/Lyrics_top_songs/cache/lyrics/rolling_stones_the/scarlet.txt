Baby, you excite me
But you talk too much
Won't stand on a corner
Love you more, oh yeah

Scarlet, why you wearing my heart on your sleeve
Where it ain't supposed to be?
Scarlet, why you tearing my heart all to pieces?
It ain't the way it's supposed to be
Scarlet, why you keeping my heart to yourself?
It ain't the way it's supposed to be
Scarlet
Scarlet

Ooh yeah

You don't have to change your mind
And leave this neighborhood so far behind
Honey, you don't have to cry no more
When I come knocking right at your front door

Scarlet
Scarlet
Scarlet

Scarlet, why you wearing my heart on your sleeve
Where it ain't supposed to be?

Scarlet
Scarlet, oooooh
Scarlet
Scarlet
Scarlet, why you wearing my heart?
Scarlet, why you wearing my heart?
Scarlet, why you wearing my heart?
Scarlet, why you wearing my heart?
Scarlet
