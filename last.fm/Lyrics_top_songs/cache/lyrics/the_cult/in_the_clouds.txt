Free your mind and float away, ooh-ooh-ooh
Lose all time and drift away
Violence in the world is on the rise again
Free yourself, spin away
Ah, climb a mountain to reach yourself
Climb a mountain to find zen, zen, zen, ay
Free your mind and drift away, yeah
Free your tribe and float away, float away, ooh
Climb a mountain to reach yourself
Ah, climb a mountain to find zen, zen, zen
Hey, hey, hey, hey
What makes you think it's ok?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
What makes you think it's ok?
It's ok?
Stroll your bones, yes, sow your oats, yeah
Love your friends and tellin' jokes
Gonna make such an entry with the gunstar season folks
Well, love, love, love in, love in the clouds, in the clouds
Climb a mountain to reach yourself
Ah, climb a mountain to find zen, zen, zen
Hey, hey
What makes you think it's ok?
Hey, hey, hey
What makes you think it's ok?
It's ok?
It's ok?
It's ok?
Free...
