If that's the way that it is, ooh
If
If that's the way that it is
If we put our hearts together
And overcome our hesitation
Maybe we could join our love as one
And storm the gates of heaven, yeah
If the winds of change
Would blow in the favour of man
Resolve our situation
Undo the work of idle temptation
Oh yeah
Well, the test of time, the test of time
Oh yeah
You know, freedom will fly, yeah
If
If that's the way that it is
We gotta fight to live
If
If that's the way that it is, yeah
We gotta fight to live, yeah
If the tribes of Eden
Could find some common ground
Share in life and wisdom
And free our minds from prison, baby
If there came a prophet
Will he show us to the promised land?
Gotta start talkin'
Gotta start talkin'
Talkin', yeah
Ooh yeah
Whoa yeah-yeah
Oh, the test of time
Oh, freedom will fly
If
If that's the way that it is, yeah-yeah
We gotta fight to live, yeah
If
If that's the way that it is, well
We gotta fight to live, ooh yeah
Runnin' out of time, yeah
Coming like a holy war
We gotta fight to live
Gotta struggle now
Fight to live
If, yeah
If that's the way that it is, yeah
We gotta fight to live, ow
If
If that's the way that it is
If that's the way that it is
We gotta fight to live
Fight to live, yeah, ow
Ooh yeah-yeah
Ow...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fight to live...
