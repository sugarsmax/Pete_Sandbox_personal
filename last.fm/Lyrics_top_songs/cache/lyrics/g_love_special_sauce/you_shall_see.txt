You've gone crazy
But I don't mind
You're gonna wish you never left my side
You shall see you should have stayed with me
When you come walkin' thru my neighborhood
You can only guess our love will be so good
You shall see, you were meant for me
You got so many plans, but I don't mind
I sure can't understand, why you left me behind
But when you realize your big mistake
You see that you was wrong but you'll be too late
Because I'll be long gone, and you will find you
Should have never left my side
She will cry, banby I don't mind
The way that you mistreated me
You were so unkind, but when you find
You'll wish you could still be mine
Now I know the reason why love had me so blind
You told me that you care
I should have read between lines
Well, now tht tables truned
You shall see
You missed your last change
To get with me
You got so many plans, but I don't mind
I sure can't understand, why you left me behind
But when you realize your big mistake
You see that you was wrong but you'll be too late
Because I'll be long gone, and you will find you
Should have never left my side
Oh, you come knockin', on my front door
You're gonnbe so sad I don't love you no more
'Cause your love is tainted
Your love is frustrated
Your love is mismated
Your love is a river, river run dry
You got so many plans, but I don't mind
I sure can't understand, why you left me behind
But when you realize your big mistake
You see that you was wrong but you'll be too late
Because I'll be long gone, and you will find you
Should have never left my side
