Up against the glass, rattling the tray
Breathless underwater, nevermind the rain

You, a faker
Use me up, and then destroy
You, a faker
Use me up, and then destroy

I'd let nature take control, but it's not possible
I'd embrace you all, but I'm on all these chemicals

You, a faker
Use me up, and then destroy
You, a faker
Use me up, and then destroy
You, a faker
You, a faker
Use me up, and then destroy
