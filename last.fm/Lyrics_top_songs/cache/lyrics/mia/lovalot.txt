They told me this is a free country
But now it feels like a chicken factory
I feel cooped up, I wanna bust free
Got nothing to lose if you get me

Like a Taliban trucker eating boiled-up yucca
Get my eyes done like I'm in a black burka
Been through shit, yeah it's a fucka'
But now I make tunes, say "shuck-a-lucka-lucka"
Shuck-a-lucka-la, shuck-a-lucka-lee
Shuck-a-lucka-lucka-lucka-lucky, lucky me
If you check me, I check you
If they kick you then I'll back you
Say something new, say something cool
Give you my time, but I ain't no fool
Eck-a-eck-a I, break-a-break-a jaw
Every-every time someone steps on my toe

I fight the ones that fight me
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
But I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight the ones that fight me
I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
But I fight the ones that fight me

Who's in town?
Them no like me, me no like them
Like Hu Jintao
Instead of them I got a new-found gem
Someone I can love up like men
Like Obama needs to love up Chen

Like a hand-me-down sucker throwing bombs out Mecca
Call the goodwill, get money to get better
Keep your head down like a Unicef worker
If you get hit you can't question the fucker
How come how come I? Yeah but yeah but why?
If I be the F, who the F be the I
If you met me then you'd get me
But if you get me will you get a fee
Shit's meant to be free, where's Bob Marley?
Cause I won't turn my cheek like I'm Gandhi
I fight the ones that fight me
I fight the ones that fight me

I fight the ones that fight me
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
But I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight the ones that fight me
I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
But I fight the ones that fight me
