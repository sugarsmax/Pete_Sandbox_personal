Hey, what now?!

Chinna girl is a little girl
From a town, that's all ya need to know
Lolita was a maneater
Clocked him like a taximeter
Fuck gold, she was platinum digger
Shakin-ass-making moves on a mover
Visa, then a plane ride to ya
Peace out, she'll kill you like Uma

She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop

Chinna girl grew up to be a big girl
Had her sights set on a bigger world
Dial-a-Bride from Sri Lanka
Found herself a Yorkshire banker
Need a Visa? Got with a geezer
Need some money? Paid him with a-knees up
Year later, started to ease-up
Got her own way, shouted out, "See ya!"

She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop
