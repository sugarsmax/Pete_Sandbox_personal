That good ass weed, too
I feel like good ass weed can solve any problem, for real

Stayed in the streets like it's room and board, they knew me for it
That’s beside the point like a shooting guard, I'm moving forward
Had aspirations of college ball, I done it all
Back on the wall, I'm so appalled, I’m gonna brawl
My fashion sense commenced when I was young
Wore guns in dungarees next to a pack of gum
Unfit mothers that's on that butter, concrete gutter
Wanna hear that gun talk, that Draco stutter
This the life I chose, and it chose me back
They threw me out to the wolves, the wolves threw me back
Got no compassion for rats
The pastor said, "Who else gon' bleed for me?"
I told all my side bitches they couldn't cheat on me, uh

They say that I'm crazy now
They said I was crazy then
They like, "Look at that crazy man"
They say, "Look at that crazy man"
They say that I'm crazy now
They said I was crazy then
They like, "Look at that crazy man"
They say, "Look at that crazy man"

I met my BM when I was 9
I had a hunch back then, but I took my time
I told 'em Trump was gon' win, they said, "You lyin’"
I seen a whole bunch of signs, I didn’t sign
I told you empty your pockets before you took my charger
I told you they wasn't solid before you took them charges
Trademark the three and then market to moms in supermarkets
Taraji P said don’t leave after I won the Best New Artist
I'm like a fortune teller, Orson Weller
More developed Shark Tank idea, I'm an orca whale, an ocean dweller
Freer than an open letter, I connect the polka dots
They just gon' say conspiracy, haters gon’ say it's photoshopped

They say that I'm crazy now
They said I was crazy then
They like, "Look at that crazy man"
They say, "Look at that crazy man"
They say that I'm crazy now
They said I was crazy then
They like, "Look at that crazy man"
They say, "Look at that crazy man"

Fuck Instagram, I don't need your blue check
Project baby, my whole family in a duplex
I be steppin' on fellas, I still be selling records
I'm 'bout to call my lil' homie to go steal me a Tesla
Travis Scott say he love I put my soul in it
And J. Cole told me that I'm the one that cold with it
Ayy, I'm outside with the glizzy, he say that boy silly
Versace on my feet, Versace on her titty
I got two chains on my neck, but I be more litty
Remember Master P told me I was the new Diddy
Master P tried to sign me, but I wasn't goin' for it
I told Birdman, "You is gon' need some more coins"
