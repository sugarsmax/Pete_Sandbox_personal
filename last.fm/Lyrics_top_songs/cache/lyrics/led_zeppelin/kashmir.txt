Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooh
Oh, baby, I been flying
No, yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh, yes, I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying, yeah

Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-ohh, oh
Oh
Ohh

Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way you stay, yeah
Ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, yeah
Ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh, oh, come on, come on
Oh, let me take you there, let me take you there
Ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah
Let me take you there, let me take you there...
