Run, desire, run
This sexual being
Run him like a blade
To and through the heart
No conscience, one motive
To cater to the hollow

Screaming, "Feed me here
Fill me up again
Temporarily pacify this hungering"

So grow, libido, throw
Dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around
In cycles, in circles
Constantly consuming
Conquer, and devour

'Cause it's time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming, "Feed me here
Fill me up again
And temporarily pacifying..."
"Feed me here
Fill me up again
And temporarily pacifying..."
