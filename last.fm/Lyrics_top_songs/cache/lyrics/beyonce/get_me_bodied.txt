Mission one: I'ma put this on

Mission two: gotta make that call
Tell him, "Get the bottles poppin' when they play my song," hey
Mission three: got my three best friends
Like we do it all the time, we gon' do it again, hey
Mission four: got the vintage Rolls
Drop a couple hundreds, tell him, "Leave it at the door," hey

I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied

Gettin' bodied (Gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (Gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied
Want my body (Gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied? (Gettin' bodied)
You want my body (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied? Hey

Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance
Wanna be myself tonight
Get me bodied

Mission five: skip to the front of the line
Let me fix my hair up 'fore I go inside, hey
Mission six: gotta check these chicks
'Cause you know they gon' block when I take these flicks, hey
Mission seven: gotta make my rounds
Givin' eyes to the guys, now I think I found him, hey
Mission eight: why we conversatin'?
We can skip small talk, let's get right to the chase, hey

I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied

Gettin' bodied (Gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (Gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)

Won't you get me bodied? Hey

You see my body
I gotta know, I need to know
If you can get me bodied
I'm kinda tight, I'm feelin' right
I need to see somebody
I wanna let it off tonight
Wanna dance, wanna party
Wanna be myself tonight

Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance
Wanna be myself tonight

Baby, all I want is to let it go (Is to let, let, let)
Ain't no worries, no (Ain't no wo-rry-rry)
We can dance all night (We can dance, dance, dance)
"Get me bodied" (Get me bodied, get me bodied)
That means come closer to me (That means closer, closer)
While we grind to the beat (Grind, grind, grind, grind)
And your body's touching my body (Body, body, body)
All I need is to let it be (Is to let, let, let)
Ain't no worry, no (Ain't no wo-rry-rry)
Boy, dance with me (We can dance, dance, dance)
Feel my body (Get me bodied, get me bodied)
Don't stop, just come closer to me (That means closer, closer)
While we grind to the beat (Grind, grind, grind, grind)
With your body touching my body (Body, body, body)
All I'm thinking 'bout is gettin' bodied
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, let me work on you

I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied

Gettin' bodied (Gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (Gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied
Want my body (Gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied? (Gettin' bodied)
You want my body (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied? Hey
