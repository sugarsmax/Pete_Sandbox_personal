I tried to see
Well I guess that I'm blind
It's fine with me
'Cause I'm gonna keep on trying, yeah
'Cause I've made disappointment my very best friend
I wait to see
Who you're gonna be and when, yeah

We don't want you to be yourself, you see
We want you to free yourself
It does no good to pretend that you are free
If you can not see you
I love you but it drags me down

I never felt like
I feel when I'm crying
I don't care where
I'm living or I'm dying, yeah

We just want you to be yourself, you see
We want you to free yourself
It does no good to pretend that you could be
Why don't you be you
I love you but you drag me down

'Cause I know it so well
How I never could tell
Who's my very best friend?
And I know it so well
I could make it be me
