Finally got the best of you

Well fuck yeah Dr. Frankenstein
Is that what you want me to say?
'Cause you're so much worse in your heart of hearts
Than the monsters you create
Monsters you create
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Well calm down Count Chocula
And put your money all on me
And I'll do my best not to let you down
But I can't work for free
Said I can't work for free

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
