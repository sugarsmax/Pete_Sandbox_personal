He would break his leg, look at me and say
It's gonna be a while, but I'll be back someday
Nothing can really stop me, steady burning slow
One hand in the air, and the other on the buffalo
One hand on the buffalo
The wind was blowing heavy, he never turned away
Knowing damn well that we would die some day
Nothing can really stop me, you're never gonna know
One hand in the air, and the other on the buffalo
