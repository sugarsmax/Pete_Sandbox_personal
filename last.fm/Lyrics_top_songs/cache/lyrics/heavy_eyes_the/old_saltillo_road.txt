(Verse 1)
There's a tree in the graveyard
On Old Saltillo Road
Stretchin' towards the moonlight
It's a sight to behold
You'll forget who you are
You'll forget why you're there
And when the dead men start to dance
You'll hardly even care
(Chorus)
Watch the fire burn
See the fire grow
Shakin' the foundations
Of everything you know
Watch the fire burn, yeah
Watch the fire burn
(Verse 2)
I was there a while
I didn't get much sleep
I couldn't walk away
From 'em when they speak
I put my faith in a promise
That they can tell no lies
I swore I saw the truth
Hidden in their eyes
(Chorus)
Watch the fire burn
See the fire grow
Shakin' the foundations
Of everything you know
Watch the fire burn, yeah
Watch the fire burn
(Bridge)
And, I was a fool back then
Yeah, I was a fool back then
Yeah, I was a fool back then
Well, I was a fool back then
Yeah, I was a fool back then
Well, I was a fool back then
Yeah, I was a fool back then
Well, I was a fool back then
To tell you the truth
I'd do it all again
