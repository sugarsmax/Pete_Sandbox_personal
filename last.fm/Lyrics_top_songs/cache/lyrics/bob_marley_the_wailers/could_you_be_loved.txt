Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved and be love?

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya, oh no
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking isn't right
Love would never leave us alone
A-in the darkness, there must come out to light

Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved, woah, yeah
And be loved?

The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers, someone else is judging you

Love your brotherman
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?

Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya
Oh no
We've got a life to live
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
They say, only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive, eh

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, woah yeah
And be loved?

Never miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied

Say something (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved? Could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something, say something
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something
Say something, say something, say something
Say something, say something (Could you be loved?)
Say something, say something, reggae, reggae
Say something, rockers, rockers
Say something, reggae, reggae
Say something, rockers, rockers
Say something (Could you be loved?)
Say something, uh
Say something, come on
Say something (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (Could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something
