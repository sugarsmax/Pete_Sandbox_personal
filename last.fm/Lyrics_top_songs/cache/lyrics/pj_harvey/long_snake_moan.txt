Dunk you under
Deep salt water
Bring me, lover
All your power
I'll be no hell
Out of your spell
Over, under
Die of pleasure

In my dreaming
You'll be drowning
Hell's low, God above
All drunk on my love

You oughta hear my long snake moan
You oughta see me from my throne

Dunk you under
Deep salt water
In my dreaming
You'll be drowning
Raise me up, lord
Call me Lazarus
Hey, Lord, heal me
Make ready my veil

You oughta hear my long snake moan
You oughta see me from my throne

It's my voodoo working
It's my voodoo working
It's my voodoo working
It's my voodoo working
