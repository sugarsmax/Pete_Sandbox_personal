Space ships can't tame the jungle
And I feel like I'm giving in
We've been drivin' through a desert
Looking for a life to call our own

I push, I pull, the days go slow
Into a void we filled with death and noise
That laughs, falls off their maps, all cured
Of pain and doubts in your little brain

Something's coming, sky is purple
Dogs are howling to themselves
Days are changing with the weather
Like a rip tide could rip us away

I push, I pull, the days go slow
Into a void we filled with death and noise
That laughs, falls off their maps, all cured
Of pain and doubts in your little brain

I push, I pull, the days go slow
Into a void we filled with death and noise
That laughs, falls off their maps, all cured
Of pain and doubts in your little brain
