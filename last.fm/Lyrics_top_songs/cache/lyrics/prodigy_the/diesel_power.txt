Yo

I used to check out lyrics upon the format
Built with skill with technique, computer ADAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought, flow, acrobat
Sync the track, pump the track
Dance missions clubs like spores react by strobe visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dance floor
Blowing up, and having mad people showing up
Packing crowds, jam-packed venues
Needles collapse while atmospheres continue
Sprinkle that, win it like that, movin' like that
Hitting like that, the melody is phat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss with Prodigy
Flipping astrology
My intellects devour
With diesel power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantas—

Win, spin back, rewind, diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
It has to be, automatically, check it out
You'd better work it out, change to another route
My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords to mics hanging like spring leaves
Do a track so fast, beyond the human eye
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
E's and pepped up, you get swept up
Smacked-up, backed-up, your crew's all cracked-up
Check it, slow pitch, who's quick, you can't stick
My metaphor range is strange as angles
You get tangled, twist inside affections
Channels repeat, complete, can't compete
Check the hour texture, mind adventure
Exploit the point into tracks, to devour
My intellects proceed with diesel power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantas—

Back attack the wack packs you faxing me
You don't want none, high-quality action be
Still standing, damaging your other man and
Quick reverse, potent as the first verse
My amplifier blows on your world's higher
World sire, cuts like a barbed wire
Record player, I pull up on you every day
Fast-forward, I move and I swing toward
Exit load, put your brain in right mode
Select and mix, the man will perfect and fix
Heads lightly, bite me, copy, Xerox
Cock sand blocks, you can't knocks 'em out there
Upbeat lifting, shifting
Persistent intelligent kingpin
Flippin' astrology
As I roll with Prodigy
With diesel power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantas—

Mono seven-oh-six, eight-oh-seven-three
Four twenty-one
Robot-sonic

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
