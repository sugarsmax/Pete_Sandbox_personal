Too tough to die
I always wonder why my mama left town
New Haven ain't a bag of salt
When nobody knows your name
You look so different over the phone
Seven states away they're doing, doing
The strange fruit swing
When they come down
You have to leave town
I am
Too tough to die
I am
Too tough to die
Blessed are those who believe
Who believe and have not seen
I wasn't there and it's got me wondering
The man you make then and now he's burning
School's are learning you can't unlearn
No room to turn, let alone run
And I am
Too tough to die
I am
Too tough to die
It's in their eyes, it's unspoken
Don't even know they're out to do you harm
Can't even see the pulse beating
In the axle of your arm
Outlaw wearing diamond patches
Of sunlight on his coat
Living in a cage, make a 7 time daddy
Lose his mind to roam
Derision's a cold wind against my skin
You keep a-flayin 'til there's no skin at all
What's to hold it together
When you stumble and you fall
I am
Too tough to die
I am
Too tough to die
