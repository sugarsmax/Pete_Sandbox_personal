I could talk but you won't listen
I could stand and watch you crawl
You could stay I bet you're wishin'
But this time it's not your call
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna see your face
You just have to wear it, 'cause
What I got's too good to waste
I cut you loose
There's no excuse
I cut you loose
You ain't no use
I cut you loose
There's no excuse
I cut you loose
You're no damn use
You just watch me slam the door
I won't feel no guilt at all
Dug your grave that much is true
Now I'm done being good to you
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna see your face
You just have to wear it, 'cause
What I got's too good to waste
I cut you loose
Got no excuse
I cut you loose
You ain't no use
I cut you loose
Got no excuse
I cut you loose
You're ain't no use
I could talk but you won't listen
I could stand and watch you crawl
You could stay I bet you're wishin'
But this time it's not your call
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna see your face
You just have to wear it, 'cause
What I got's too good to waste
I cut you loose
There's no excuse
I cut you loose
Hell, ain't no use, boy
I cut you loose
You ain't no use
I cut you loose
And I don't need no damn excuse
I cut you loose
I got no excuse
I cut you loose
You ain't no use
I cut you loose
You ain't no use
I cut you loose
Don't stand on my blues
I cut you loose
