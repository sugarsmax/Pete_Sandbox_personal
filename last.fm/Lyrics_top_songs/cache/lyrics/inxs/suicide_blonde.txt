Don't you know what you're doing? (Oh)
You've got a death wish, yeah?
Suicide blonde, suicide blonde
Suicide blonde, suicide blonde

Suicide blonde was the colour of her hair
Like a cheap distraction for a new affair
She knew it would finish before it began
Woah, baby, you lost the plan

You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde

She stripped to the beat, but her clothes stay on
White light everywhere, but you can't see a thing
Such a squeeze, a mad, sad moment
Glory to you, glory to you, take me there
Ooh, take me there (Ow)

You got some revelation put into your hands
Save you from your misery, like rain across the land
Don't you see the colour of deception?
Turning your world around again

You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde, say it

(You wanna make—)
(You wanna make—)
You wanna make her suicide blonde
You wanna make— (Hahaha)
Ow

That's the story
Everything you wanna be
Everything you are, are
Mm-mm, yeah


You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde (Oh)
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde, yeah

Love devastation
You wanna make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You wanna make her suicide blonde
