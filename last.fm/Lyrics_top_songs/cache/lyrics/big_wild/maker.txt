Another place where I can be
Another dream to carry away
To carry away
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Another world that waits for me
Another life
I can wait for that
I can wait for that 'til we meet again

A beating heart into the night
A lovely whisper that tells me to go
Tells me to go
Ooh-ooh-ooh

An open door that waits for me
A warm embrace
I can wait for that
I can wait for that 'til we meet again

'Til we meet again
'Til we meet again

Another world that waits for me
Another life
I can wait for that
I can wait for that 'til we meet again

I can wait, I can wait, I can wait (For you)
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait (For you)
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait
I can wait for that 'til we meet again
'Til we meet again
'Til we meet again
I can wait for that 'til we meet again

I can wait, I can wait, I can wait (For you)
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait (For you)
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait (For you)
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait (For you)
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait (For you)
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait (For you)
