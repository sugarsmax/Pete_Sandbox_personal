Lie, lie to my face
Tell me it ain't nothing, that's what I wanna hear
Take the lie to the grave
That's what an old friend told me, look what it did for him

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in
Heaven now

Run, you'll never escape
You'll see you go nowhere, so new you appear
Broke, laid to waste
Turn into sweet nothings, kiss you goodbye

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in
Heaven now

Keep goin' over and over again
The never ending places I've never been
No one's catchin' on, callin' my bluff
The Devil made me holier than every man
What'd you do? Say it with a smile, boy
Makin' us all forget
What'd you do? Say it with a smile, boy
Makin' us all forget
Making us all forget
Making us all forget
