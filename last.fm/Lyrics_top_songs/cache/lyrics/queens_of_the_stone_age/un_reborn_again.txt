Uh

Skinny knows jack, Skinny knows jack
Knowin' nothin' about nothin', it's a blessin' in fact
Acid-faced Jake, acid-faced Jake
He like them dancin' straight boys, makes his pupils dilate
Juzzy come quick, Juzzy come quick
Tell the doctor to come over, bring emergency kit
Evil old Scratch, evil old Scratch
He drink the water from the gutter, it's a natural fact, yeah

Youth
You could be young again
Anew
Be un-reborn again
Askew

Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth, you can almost reach
Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth, you can almost reach
A fever

Well, Chi-Chi gon' shake, Chi-Chi gon' shake
Ti rompo il culo, c'est magnifiqué óde lay
Twizzy gon' twitch, Twizzy gon' twitch
He said no huggy, no kissy until I get a wedding ring
K Dubs cuts quick, takin' no shit
Give a metal blow job, middle finger and split
(No no no no…)

Youth
And you could be young again
Anew
Be un-reborn again
(Youth) Right where the map ends
(You could be young again) Is where its hid
(Anew) Under the X is
(Be un-reborn again) Where it lives
Askew

Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth, I can almost reach
Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth, I can almost reach
(Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally) I had a vision as clear as day
(Buried so close to the fountain of youth, I can almost reach) Was delusions of grandeur in our DNA
(Frozen in pose, locked up in amber eternally) Every drop like an ocean, a moment of truth
(Buried so close to the fountain of youth, I can almost reach) Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth

Screamin', du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-do
Screamin', du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-doo
Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-doo-ooh-oh-hey
Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-doo

There's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain
Come drink from the water before it's been drained away
Every drop like an ocean, every moment undone
Implosions of beauty back to where we begun
There's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain
Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth
Screamin', du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-do
Screamin', mm-hm, mm-hm, hm-hm, hmmm-hmmm-hmmm
