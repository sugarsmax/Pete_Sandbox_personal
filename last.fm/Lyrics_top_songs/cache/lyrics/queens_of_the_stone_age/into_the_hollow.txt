Au revoir, adieu, goodnight
I'm too wrong to get right

But I can't wait forever
I've always been alone, a fool who believes he's clever

Don't you wanna go into the hollow?
I won't go alone, aren't you gonna follow?
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I live behind my eyes
Be sure to keep the surprise

I break what I have borrowed
That's why I always go alone into tomorrow

Don't you wanna go into the hollow?
I won't go alone, aren't you gonna follow?

In the hollow
In the hollow
Into the hollow
Into the hollow
