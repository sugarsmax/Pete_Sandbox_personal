(Aight, off?)

Too late to think or filter anymore
A bitter pill to swallow, maybe you're
In a blanket haze of ephedrine, I'm wondering where the hell you been
So come on and right this wrong, the rope

You've got it all right, you got a feelin'
I'd rather open up my wrist, let it go
You got it all right, you got a feelin'
'Cause devils and ropes around your neck, cursin' them all
And you can't hear it, can't hear it

Ain't got a mind to deal with anymore
Saboteur infiltrator, and maybe more
If you're not blind and deaf, how can we pollute your head?
So come on and right this wrong, the rope

And I got it all right, I got a feelin'
You'd rather open up your wrist, let it go
And I got it all right, yeah, I got a feelin'
There's devils and ropes around my neck, can't even know
'Cause I can't hear it, can't hear it
Can't hear it, can't hear it
