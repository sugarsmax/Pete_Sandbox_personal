I've been waiting
Waiting under things that rise in the morning
I've been holding, holding back so long
You can own it
Take it off my hands, do me a favor
Nothing wasted
Just fingerfucked and busted up all at once


I'm so lost out on the highway
With no direction left to go
Everyday sit up and wonder
Where it was I started from

The more you've found
The less you've been around
The more you've found
The less you've been around (Ah)

The more you've found
The less you've been around
The more you've found
The less you've been around
The more you've found
The less you've been around
The more you've found
The less you've been around (Ah)
Ah-yeah, yeah-ah-yeah
