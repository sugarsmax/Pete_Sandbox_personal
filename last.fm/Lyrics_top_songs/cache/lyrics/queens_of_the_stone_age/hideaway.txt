The kid who wants some of the pretties in life
Tried shortcuts, those are myths despite
The first hands, the backhands, the bruises, the bites
The painful spoonful the hustle invites

Speak my name and I'll appear
Right here

Hideaway
Hideaway, mm

I'm all dressed up, no one left to blow
Addiction to friction leaves you raw
Left with the taste of flesh and bone
It's a beautiful day in the USA

I requires a pupil, and I'm sure
It's yours

Hideaway
Hideaway

You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms

You'll feel love

Innocence is what you lose
Like keys and dreams and old tattoos
With one quick twist love turns to scar
Cruising the bruises in my car

Catch the keys and take the wheel and drive
For a while

Hideaway
Hideaway

You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms
You owe me everything
You owe me everything

And you'll feel love
Oh, you'll feel love
Hold my hand
Oh, you'll feel love
You'll feel love
You'll feel love
Who needs love?
