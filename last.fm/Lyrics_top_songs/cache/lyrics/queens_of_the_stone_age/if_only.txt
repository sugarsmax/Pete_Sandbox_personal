If it gets you down, well then I'll take it
If it gets you up, well, I don't want it
It let you down, so broken-hearted
If it gets you down, well then I want it

If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only, it was nothing at all


So blow our mind and make it lazy
Those long, long days with no escapin'
I hold the wheel to let it go, don't wanna stop, don't wanna know
If it gets you down, well just don't blame me

If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only, it was nothing at all
