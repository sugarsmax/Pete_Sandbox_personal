Cracks in the ceiling, crooked pictures in the hall
Countin' and breathin', I'm leavin' here tomorrow
They don't know, I never do you any good
Laughin' is easy, I would if I could

Ain't gonna worry
Just live 'til you die, I wanna drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone who
There's nothin' to save and I know
You live 'til you die

(Live 'til you die) I know
(Live 'til you die) I know
(Live 'til you die) I know
(Live 'til you die)

Losin' a feelin' that I couldn't give away
Countin' and breathin', disappearin' in the fade
They don't know, I'd never do you any good
Stoppin' and stayin', I would if I could

Ain't gonna worry
Just live 'til you die, I wanna drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone who
There's nothin' to save and I know
You live 'til you die

(Live 'til you die) I know
(Live 'til you die) I know
(Live 'til you die) I know
(Live 'til you die)
