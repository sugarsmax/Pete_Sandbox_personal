Woo! (Alright)

You've got a question? Please don't ask, yeah
It puts the lotion in the basket
You say bigger's better but bigger's bigger
White boy dressed up like a figure

Drawn inside a toilet on the wall
The world is round, my square don't fit at all

Oh

They say those who can't just instruct others
And act like victims or jilted lovers
You can't lose it if you never had it
Disappear man, do some magic

Want a reason? How's about because?
You ain't a has-been if you never was

I sound like this


Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do (Oh)
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do (Oh)
(Oh) Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do
(Oh) Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do
(Oh) Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do
(Oh) Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do
(Oh)
(Oh) Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do-do
(Oh)

Scared to say, what is your passion?
So slag it all, bitter's in fashion
Fear of failure's all you've started
The jury's in, verdict: retarded

I'm so tired, and I'm wired too
I'm a mess I guess, I'm turnin' on the screw
