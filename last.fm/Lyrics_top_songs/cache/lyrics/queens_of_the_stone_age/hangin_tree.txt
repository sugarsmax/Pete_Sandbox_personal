Would you like a way home?
I'll bleed my own

'Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
'Round the hanging tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swayin'

Can you see under my thumb?
There you are

'Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
'Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swayin'


'Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
'Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swayin'
