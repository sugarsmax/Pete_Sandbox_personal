The blue pill opens your eyes, is there a better way?
A new religion's prescribed to those without the faith
A hero holding a knife, and blood is not enough
Is it too late to go back? Is it too late to go?

There's no one here (
There's no one here
)
And people everywhere (
People everywhere
)
You're on your own

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Let's see if I'm hearing this right, you suggest I should take
A never-ending supply to carry out the dead
Your idols burn in the fire, the mob comes crawlin' out
I'm reclaiming my mind, destroying everyone

There's no one here (
There's no one here
)
And people everywhere (
People everywhere
)
You're all alone

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
