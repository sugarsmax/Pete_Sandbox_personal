Nothing, nothing, nothing inside
And there's no reason to cry, just fade away like love
Clutching, hanging by a nail in this life
Desperate always, always looks that way
Free fall from the nest, then glide to the left
A shine catch the eye, so flow out to the right
Flying high, realize there are no more mountains to climb

When there's nothing I can do
Accept, enjoy the view
When there's nothing I can do
I smile

Minutes, seconds and so little time
Give your secrets away? Well, whisper in my ear
Every living thing will die from the king of the jungle to butterfly
The only sin is waiting too long

When there's nothing I can do, I smile
I smile wide, ooh

Free fall from the nest, then glide to the left
A shine catch the eye, so flow out to the right
Flying high, realize there are no more mountains to climb

We live, we die
We fail, we rise
I'm a vulture, so I hear goodbyes
There's no end to life
On and on, always life
On and on, always life
