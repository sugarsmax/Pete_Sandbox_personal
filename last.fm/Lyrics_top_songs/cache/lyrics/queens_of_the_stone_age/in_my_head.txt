It's the cruelest joke to play
I'm so high, I run in place
Only a line we separate, so

I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

You're the only thing I've got
But I can't seem to get enough
We collide for one embrace, so

I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it
I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

Oh
Oh
Hurry up
And wait forever

I keep on playin' our favorite song (Hurry up)
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head (And wait for forever)
And you're in my head, so I need it

Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba

I keep on playin' our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all I've got when you're in my head
And you're in my head, so I need it

I need it
I need it
I need it now
