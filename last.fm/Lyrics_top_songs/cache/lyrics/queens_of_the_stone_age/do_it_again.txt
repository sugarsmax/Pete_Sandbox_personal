Hey, hey
Hey

I fall over and over and over and over
Oh, I want you
I get ill, I get ill, I get ill
You're the only one I'm into

You and me
Fit so tight

I go lower and lower and lower and lower
Livin' easy
I don't know, I don't know that I got 'til it's over

You and me
Fit so tight

Can you do it again?
Do it again
Do it again
Can you do it again?
Hey, hey
Hey

All the way, all the way, all the way
There's nowhere left we can meet (Oh)
I'm into what you do, but I leave you nowhere

You and me (Hey)
Fit so tight (Hey, hey)
All we need (Hey)
Is one more time (Hey, hey)

Can you do it again?
Do it again
Do it again
Can you do it again?
Do it again
Do it again
Can you do it again?

I only get to live one life
Won't pretend you're only mine
Where will you go?
Where we all find the way
So do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again (Hey, hey)
Do it again (Hey, hey)
Do it again (Hey, hey)

We're promoting a blood dri—
Oh, shit
Not guilty
Welcome to the South of America
You're listening to AM 580
Lay back, sheep, little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
God told me so to my face (Cannot be saved)
Follow me and I will
Good to know that he's walking with me
Big rock as a weapon
The devil is a bla—
And let him cast the first stone
Jesus, Jes—
And you have fallen into the love that needs to be
Designed by the Lord
Hallelujah, y'all, I wanna hear a couple of hallelujahs
