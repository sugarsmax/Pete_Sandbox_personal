Saw you in a way beyond figurin' out
These lines of life have been drawn, and can't be removed
Our eyes is all it took to know
Open up your eyes, deep blue, glassy lake
And swim 'til water and sky now are one, out of two
Oh, my bloodshot eyes
Open up your mouth, touch your lips to mine
That we may make a kiss that can pierce through death and survive
Your words have branded my mind


But still I hold your hand, wrapped as if a ring
We of flesh and blood are only carrying
It's so hard to
Well, you know
The seed waits for the reaper to sow
Every breath an art, the dignity to learn it
Can strain and break your heart
Take all your pieces home
You ask when you're alone, "What is love?"
The blood is love
