Where have you gone again, my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where have you gone again, my sweet?
Everybody wants to know

Where you gone?
Where you gone? Oh-oh

I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waitin', when you comin' home?
I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waitin', when you comin' home?

Gone so long, oh
Where you gone?

On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye?

In every voice, I hear you speak
Waitin' by the telephone
I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Roll and tumble all night long

All night long, oh-oh
Where you gone? Oh yeah

On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow good…

I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Where have you gone again, my sweet?

On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye?

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
