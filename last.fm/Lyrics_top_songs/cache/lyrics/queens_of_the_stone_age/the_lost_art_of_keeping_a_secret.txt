Well I've got a secret, I cannot say
A modern movement to give it away
You've got somethin', that I understand
Hold it in tightly, call on command
Leap of faith, do you doubt?
Cut you in, I just cut you out

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Look for reflections in your face
Canine devotion, time can't erase
Out on the corner, or locked in your room
I never believe them, and I never assume
Stuck in belief, there is a lie
Promise is promise, an eye for an eye
We've got somethin' to reveal
No one can know how we feel

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do, hoo-hoo
Don't tell

I think you already know
How far I'd go not to say
You know the art isn't gone
And I'm takin' our song to the grave


Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do, hoo-hoo
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't tell
