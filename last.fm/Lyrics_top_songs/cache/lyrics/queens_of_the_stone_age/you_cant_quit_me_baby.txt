It's a mistake, but who knows?
Followed you home, crawled in your window
This life is a trip when you're psycho in love
And I know, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

Followed your friends, you were not there
Slashed and I cut, I bled in the sink
Heard what you said, and you're laughin', maybe
Slashed and I cut, and I do it for you
I want you to notice when I'm not around
Wherever you are, oh-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-ah, oh-oh-oh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh


(Oh-oh-oh) You're solid gold, I'll see you in hell
(Oh-oh-oh) You're solid gold, I'll see you in hell
(Oh-oh-oh) You're solid gold, I'll see you in hell
(Oh-oh-oh) You're solid gold, I'll see you in hell

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
