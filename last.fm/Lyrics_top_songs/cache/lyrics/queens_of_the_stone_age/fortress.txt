Your heart is like a fortress, you keep your feelings locked away
Is it easier? Does it make you feel safe?
You wander through the darkness of wilderness behind your eyes
I know you're afraid, but you gotta move on

Every fortress falls, it is not the end
It ain't if you fall but how you rise that says
Who you really are, so get up and come through
If ever your fortress caves, you're always safe

I believe I know you, yet I don't truly know myself
I pray you won't feel as alone as I have felt
I don't want to fail you, so I tell you the awful truth
Everyone faces darkness on their own
As I have done, so will you

Every fortress falls, it is not the end
It ain't if you fall but how you rise that says
Who you really are, so get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves, you're always safe in mine

The Earth spins 'round the sun
And behold, everything happens
Every night falls prey to sunrise

If your fortress is under siege
You can always run to me
If your fortress is under siege, you can always run

Every fortress falls, it is not the end
It ain't if you fall but how you rise that says
Who you really are, so get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves, you're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves, you're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves, you're always safe in mine

Come on through
Come on through
