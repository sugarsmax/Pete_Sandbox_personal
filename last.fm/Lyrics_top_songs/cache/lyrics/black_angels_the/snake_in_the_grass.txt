Someday, but not today
We will move away
To a place that's nice and safe
Someday, but not today
Someone, is your King
And you look up to them, yeah
Divine in their way
And you say, yeah you say
You better believe her
She gave you plenty warning
Floating on a moat
Yeah, you digging the moat
And you say, yeah, you say
"Oh now, bring me joy
Lead me with your army
You take our children
With your bloodstained hands"
You better believe her
Alright, alright
You got my love
And that's fine
All night, all night
I swear to the highest high
I will keep it mine
A promise with a catch
I'm sleeping with a smile
And you're safe, but just today
You better believe me
One night, when she goes blind
Find her where she sleeps
Wake her from her dreams
Shh, it's ok
She gave you plenty warning
