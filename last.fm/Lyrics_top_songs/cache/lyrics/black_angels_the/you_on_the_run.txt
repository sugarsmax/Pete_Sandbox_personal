Now you on the run, son
Since 1981
Yeah, you went and did some things
And spoiled the fun
Yeah, you got the FBI
They ain't on your side
Yeah, you're caught fooling, friend
With a senator's wife

Oh, I don't need it
Well no one does

Just sit on this groove and chew
As the heat grew and grew
A life of taking love
She fit like a glove

And in due time
Yeah, I'll be there

Well, hello, harmony
Whatcha doing for free?
Yeah, get on your knees, you freak
And please, please me
A life of solitude
Yeah, one with me, no you
Life on the run, son
It's all you knew

And I don't need it
No, no one does
Ah!
Ooh!
