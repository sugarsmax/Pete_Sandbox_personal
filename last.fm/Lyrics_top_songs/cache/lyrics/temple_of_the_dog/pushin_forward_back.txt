Mother, mother found me on her step
Gracious mother held me to her breast
Until the day I started pushin'
Too late to cry, she turned away, I started pushin'
I saw no future in this lack

I started pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back

Baby brother clinging to her hair
Gracious mother pleading, "Not another soul to bear,"
He started pushin'
All my kings have fallen down, I started pushin'
Fallen heroes feed the ground

I started pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back

Fallin' down, now I know her
I know I'll never drown, drown, drown
Fallin' down, now I know her
I know I'll never drown, drown, drown
Ah, I was pushin'

I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
