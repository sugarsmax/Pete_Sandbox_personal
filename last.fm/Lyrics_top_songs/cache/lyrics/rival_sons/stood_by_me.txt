Yeah, I've been gone a long time
But I'm back where I belong now
Yeah, I was out of my mind
But I'm back and feeling strong now

Good friends are hard to find, yeah
Sure mama, you're one of mine, yeah

Now I'm calling you out 'cause I got to say thank you
You stood by me when I said I didn't need you

Yeah, I swam out so far
But you couldn't see my head on the water
Yeah, that's when you jumped in to swim
Tossin' me further

Good friends are hard to find, yeah
Sure mama, you're one of mine, yeah

Now I'm calling you out 'cause I got to say thank you
You stood by me when I said I didn't need you
Now I'm calling you out 'cause I got to say thank you
You stood by me when I said I didn't need you

Now I'm calling you out 'cause I got to say thank you
You stood by me when I said I didn't need you
Now I'm calling you out 'cause I got to say thank you
You stood by me when I said I didn't need you
