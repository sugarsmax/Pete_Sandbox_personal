You watch the incision
On your very own children on your television
In your own reflection
You deny the protection of your own infection

I can hear you calling me
I recognize your voice
Saying "Don't look away"
I won't look away, I won't look away

You watch the distribution
Of a mass confusion spread by the institution
Sell your inclusion of you and your own illusion
Instead of thinking you're the solution

I can hear you calling me
I recognize your voice
Saying "Don't look away"
I won't look away, I won't look away

If it's someone else's problem
Somebody else's pain
If it's someone else's problem
Somebody else's pain
It's someone else's problem
Somebody else's pain

I can hear you calling me
I recognize your voice
Saying "Don't look away"
I won't look away, I won't look away
I can hear you calling me
I recognize your voice
Saying "Don't look away"
I won't look away, I won't look away
