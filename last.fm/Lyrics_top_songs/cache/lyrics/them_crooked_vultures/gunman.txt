Gunman, grain of sand
Sisters could not speak
Father is a holy ghost
Then there's lions in a cage

It don't matter, don't try to explain
You're just another dog to be trained
Choke-chained
You're gonna end up under tooth and nail
If you catch a tiger by the tail
Don't fail


Brother does not dream anymore
Sisters could not sleep
Transformation incomplete, mercy killing those counting sheep
I'm the trigger, quick to fire, punctuate betwixt the eyes
You're clever, it ain't gonna help you

Violence is just an incomplete thought
Coming to a complete stop
Stop
You're so clever, you'll tear us apart
Then masquerade it as art
Not smart
If you can help anyone, help yourself
That's unless you hate yourself
Then don't help

Angry ants are crawlin'
Makes you wanna scream

Lions clawing
Building up steam
Flesh and bone has no persuasion, this is the pathway to my destination
Gunman, where you been?
You're my hero, savior, psycho, slayer

Follow the leader, you lead 'em the same
Slugs punctuate the refrain
Come again?
It don't matter, don't try to explain
You're just a dog to be trained
Choke-chained
You're gonna end up under tooth and nail
If you catch a tiger by the tail
Don't fail
I wanna go blind, wanna stare at the sun
De-evolution
