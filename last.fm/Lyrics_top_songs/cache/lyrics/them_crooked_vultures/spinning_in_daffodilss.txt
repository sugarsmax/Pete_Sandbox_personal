Once, out in the rain
I was able to strangle my shadow, unshackle the chain (Chain)
What, What will you do?
Is it safe to play God in the garden and king of the zoo? (You)
Holes, well, they need to be filled
Positions available, yet some are quite hard to get out of, or in (In)

Spinning in the daffodils
Dizzy from a dozen twirls
Spinning in the daffodils

Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Cold, alone and alive
You're afraid but that's not what I asked, wanna go for a ride?
Sharpen your teeth, my darlings, sharpen your minds
Take a finger if the hand feeds you shit, take one scalp at a time
Get 'em boys, yeah, yeah

Fail, as big as a whale
Like a canine that chases the bone that's tied to its tail
I wish I was a beautiful balloon
I could rise up above it all and then fade out of view (Fade)
Gracefully fade, fade out of view
What have you turned me into?

Spinning in the daffodils
Dizzy from a dozen twirls
Spinning in the daffodils

(Oh, yeah)
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
What have you gone and done, my love?
Incinerated in the morning sun
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
(Yeah, yeah)

I'm so high
I just may never come down
I'm so high
I just may never come down
I'm so high
I just may never come down
I'm so high
I just may never come down, yeah-yeah-yeah
I'm so high
I just...
I just may never come down
I'm so high
I just may never come down
I'm...
