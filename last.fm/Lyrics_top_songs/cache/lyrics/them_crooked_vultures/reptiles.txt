I tried to make a break, what a fool
I should've known, I never listen
I'm in a cage, an animal, I'm in a cage

But the reptiles, they won't let me go
I think they want you to stray

Watch the monkey dance, give him a taste
Look at him, he's always smiling
Help me to escape, your mouth agape, you foreign tourist

Woe is me, it will be a funeral
A circus, I'll rap on the cell door

Questions are a fire that needs feeding to survive
So just you let those flames die down

Trained by consequence and the lash, it leaves me breathless
Their praise is a poison to us all
In the moonlight their scars flash like jewelry
Get too precious, get locked up in a cage

Wanna get, gotta risk any move
Misconstrued, then you're screwed
Tongues flash and flick as if they're screaming

Oh, they lie just like a lover
Oh, do they, those kisses will burn

Under the lights, they snap a finger
You jump, you answer
Like a naive hooker with a big dumb smile

For the reptiles, I guess you'll never know
They won't let you go 'cause you're the soup du jour, that's for sure

Questions are a fire that needs feeding to survive
So just you let those flames die down
See them reptiles crawl, getting closer
Why won't someone come to drive them away?

Don't rest too long, it's a mistake we can't take back
Take one lying down for a change
And, oh, it's like cleaning up after an orgy when it's over
I wish someone would burn this place to the ground
