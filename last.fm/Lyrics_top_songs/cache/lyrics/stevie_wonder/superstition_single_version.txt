Very superstitious
Writings on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladders 'bout to fall
13 month-old baby
Broke the lookin’ glass
7 years of bad luck
The good things in your past

When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah

Ooh, very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me goin’ strong
You don't wanna save me
Sad is my song

When you believe in things you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way – yeah, yeh

Ahhhh-huh!
Ow!

Very superstitious
Nothin' more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
13 month-old baby
Broke the lookin' glass
7 years of bad luck
Good things in your past – mhm

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer!
Superstition ain’t the way
No, no, no!
