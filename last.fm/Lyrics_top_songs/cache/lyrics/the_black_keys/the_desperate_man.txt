Alright

See her walking with a fella
Two of them, so nice and mella
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
My heart is broken, it's open wide
Feel so down, deep inside
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey, alright
(Hit it)

Summer's here but I'm still in fall
Wondering what she done me for
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey, alright
I'm too far down, deepest ditch
Too far gone to ever switch
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
(Hit it)
(Alright, yeah)
(Alright, yeah, yeah, alright)

(Hit it, alright, alright)
Drive all night now without a care
Hope to catch you standing there
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
Don't forsake a desperate man
Hope you know that's who I am
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
(Alright, yeah)
(Hit it, alright, yeah)
(Ahh, ahh)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
