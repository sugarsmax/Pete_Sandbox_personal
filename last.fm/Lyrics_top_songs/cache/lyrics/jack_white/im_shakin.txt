1,2 a'1,2,3,4
Yeah, when you touch my hand and talk sweet talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk
And I'm tremblin'
That's right, you got me shakin'
When you take me in your arms and talk romance
My heart starts doin' that Saint Rita's dance
And I'm pantin'
Oh and I'm shakin'
Early in the mornin' time
Late in the middle of the night
Whenever this chill comes over me
I wanna hug ya' with all of my might
That's right and I'm sweatin'
Oh, yeah ya' got me shakin'
Mmm, ya' got me sweatin'
Oh, yeah ya' got me shakin' girl
A chill and a fever, so I've been told
Makes your head spin around and your feet run cold
I got fever, yeah
Fever yeah I burn forsooth
I feel like I been run right through the mill
And I can't move around and I can't stand still
I'm Bo Diddley
Oh, you got me shakin'
I'm so jittery
That's right, you got me shakin'
Well Samson was a mighty good man
Strongest in his day
(Then along came Delilah and clipped his wig)
And it looks like you took me the same old way
So I'm nervous
Oh and I'm shakin'
Alright, you got me nervous
Yeah, I'm shakin' and jumpin'
A storm rocks a ship on a sea (A storm rocks a ship on a sea)
The wind shakes the leaves on a tree (The wind shakes the leaves on a tree)
And I'm a nervous wreck and I'm all shook up
And that's what you're doin' to me right now
And I'm jumpin'
That's right, you got me shakin'
Oh and I'm jumpin'
That's right, you got me shakin'
Oh, ya' got me shakin'
That's right, ya' got me nervous
Oh, oh
But now I'm shakin'
Oh, you got me shakin'
Yeah
