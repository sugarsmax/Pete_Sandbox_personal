Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness, yeah

I'm in a parked car on a crowded street
And I see my love made complete
The thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness

Love is clockworks and it's cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Blindness (blindness)

Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me? Yeah
Oh, my love
Blindness

Yeah, a little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, it's a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense, yeah yeah

Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets and nobody else to tell
Take the money, why don't you honey?
Blindness, yeah

Love is blindness
I'm so sick of it, I don't wanna see
Why don't you just take the night
Wrap it all around me, now?
Oh, my love
Blindness
Love is blindness, mmm
Oh, I'm too numb to feel, yeah
Blow out the candle
Blindness
