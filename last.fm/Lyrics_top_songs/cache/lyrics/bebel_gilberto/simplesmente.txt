Every moment I'm near you
I try to understand
Every second I try to believe
In how I am
In the silence of moonlight
I find myself and you
Just as always I'm dreaming
I know you're dreaming too
And all the tears that I've cried
Are maybe drops of rain
After all
And every sunset sky
Is here with us forever now
Quando canto me lembro
De tudo o que é bom
Só passando por muito
Eu sei o que é dôr
(When I sing I remember
Of everything that's good
Just being through a lot
I know what is pain)
Não quero nunca esconder
Talvez eu possa até me arrepender
Só porque então pensei
Que gente possa ser
Bem mais que um simplesmente ser
(I never want to hide
Maybe I can even regret
Just because then I thought
That people can be
Much more that a simple being)
Don't have to try too hard
It's not a secret held after all
'Cause every falling star
Is here with us (forever)
Não quero nunca perder
Talvez eu pense até em querer
Só porque então pensei
Que gente possa ser
Bem mais que um simplesmente
(I never want to hide
Maybe I can even regret
Just because then I thought
That people can be
Much more that a simple being)
