Hold back the rain

Yes, we're miles away from nowhere
And the wind doesn't have a name
So call it what you want to call it
Still blows down the lane

And if the fires burn out, there's only fire to blame
(Hold back the rain)
No time for worry 'cause we're on the roam again
(Hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter, and we ride the outside lane
(Hold back the rain)
Not on your own, so help me, please, hold back the rain

Okay, go off and wander
I'm guilty just the same
Sometimes you're needed badly
So please come back again

And if the stars burn out, there's only fire to blame
(Hold back the rain)
No time for worry 'cause we're on the roam again
(Hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter, and we ride the outside lane
(Hold back the rain)
Not on your own, so help me, please, hold back the rain
(Hold back the rain), hold back the rain, (Hold back the rain)
Hold back the rain
Hey, hey, hold back the rain
Everyone, please, please, please, help me hold back the rain
I just.. want to stay to.. help you hold back the rain
Hold, hold back the rain
Hold, hold back the rain

And if the fires burn out, there's only fire to blame
(Hold back the rain)
No time for worry 'cause we're on the roam again
(Hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter, and we ride the outside lane
(Hold back the rain)
Not on your own, so help me, please, hold back the rain

Hold back the rain, hold back the rain, (Hold back the rain)
Hold back the rain, (Hold back the rain), hold back the rain
