Wait a minute my friend
Don't pass me up for dead
As Babylon crumbles to sand
A flower blossoms in my hand
The people drifting by
Another day ends
Another day ends
An eventful day ends
Why am I alive?
See my ribbons flowing
I don't want to be like you
Don't want be like you!
There's no others
There's no others
We're burning up in here
My body's burning
We're burning up in here
There's no others
The voice of the people cry
Drone on in monotone
Here is the news
It's all so sad
On the black and white
The diluted truth
Pennies will make it pure again
Pennies make it pure
Don't ask me why
People are drifting by
Indifferent to stormy skies
Another day ends
The last others fall down
Another day ends
Why am I alive?
Why am I alive?
See my ribbons flowing
I don't want to be like you
Don't want to be like you!
There's no others
There's no others
There's no others
There are no others in here
There are no others in here
Bleed me dry, well bleed me dry
Bleed me dry, bleed us all dry
