We love money, money
Especially we love money
Money
We make a heap of money

My name is M-O-E, super Japanese girl
I was born in the mouth-to-mouth (What?)
We something tasty, crazy, gonna crazy
We in the house on every day
Oh yeah
All right
Okay, my lips, my eyes: like pure sugar
Birds and the bees dancing on my shoulders
Hey boys
Let's get
Money money money


Look for Yuppa, hi, born on a snowy day
You know I'm beatmaker, A.K.A lovemaker
My choice is always curry and rice
I need a more, more spicy one
Love to dance with funky stuff
Love to kiss you, with Andy Partridge
"Do you love me?"
Of course I do
If you own any money!


We want money
We want boys
We want big jump and not hard walking!
We want sexy bodies
We want lollipops
We want many money
Many many boys

Money, money, money, money
