I'm so glad, yeah, I'm glad baby
Trouble don't last always
I'm so glad, yeah, I'm glad baby
Trouble don't last always
See me smiling and laughing
Some of these sunny days
When I have you, baby
Thought you would always be true
Look here pretty baby, now
Look at you made me do
I may be sad, now babe
Maybe sad and maybe blue
One of these shiny mornings
I forget about you
All alone, baby
In this empty room
I may be gone, pretty baby
I'll be coming back soon
I'm so glad, yeah
I'm so glad baby
Trouble don't last always
I'll be smiling and laughing
Some of these sunny days
I'm glad, yeah
Yeah, I'm glad
