Loud talk, dumb love, lacerator
Come and touch
Bleed to feel, feel to fuck
Keep you coming, coming back for more
Alcohol, it's a lie, stimulate a needle in your eye
Let it bleed, blow your mind
Touched myself, nearly went blind

Couldn't find a way to live though the pain
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Couldn't get out of bed
Ten ton bricks laying on my head
Persecute the crucified
Kill a man for losing his mind

Couldn't find a way to live though the shame
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Come on out, you're coming home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone
Come on out, you're coming home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone

Couldn't find a way to live though the pain
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love
Couldn't find another way to win the race
Couldn't find a way
Dumb love

Come on out, you're coming home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone
Come on out, you're coming home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone
Come on out, you're coming home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone
Come on out, you're coming home
Deceive yourself, you're all alone
