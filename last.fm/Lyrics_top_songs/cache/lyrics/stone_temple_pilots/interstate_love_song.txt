Waitin' on a Sunday afternoon
For what I've read between the lines
Your lies
Feelin' like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh or does it cry?
Reply?

Leavin' on a southern train, only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be, only watched the time go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathin' is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you
You lied, goodbye

Leavin' on a southern train, only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be, only watched the time go by
All of these things I said to you
