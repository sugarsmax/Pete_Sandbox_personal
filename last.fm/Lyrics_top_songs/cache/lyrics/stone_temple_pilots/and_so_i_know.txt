And so I know
It's begun again
Never be the same and with that I said
Never, ever, ever be this way again
Hold on 'til the end (Campfire girls make me)
Like it's the last hello (Feel alright)
Whirlwinds and roller-coasters (Campfire girls make me)
Long grass making shapes hello (Feel alright)
Disappearing, disappearing floating graves

Never, ever, ever, ever be this way
And never, ever be this way again
Never, ever, ever, ever be this way
And never, ever be this way again

And so I know (Campfire girls make me)
It's begun again (Feel alright)
Never be the same (Campfire girls make me)
And with that I said (Feel alright)
Campfire girls make me feel alright
Campfire girls make me feel alright
Campfire girls
