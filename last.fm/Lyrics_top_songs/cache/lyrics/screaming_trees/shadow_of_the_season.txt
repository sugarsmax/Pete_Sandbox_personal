The hour is ending, can't you see?
There is no way now, to be free
In the shadow of the season
Without a reason to carry home
A reason
Without a reason
And from the north woods down to the valley
In a world of hurting, I'm moving on
Out from the lighthouse, out on the ocean
Can't climb the mountain, so very tall
Said, "Lord please give me what I need"
He said, "There's pain and misery"
Oh, sweet oblivion feels alright
The hour is drawing ever closer
And rolling over, won't let me be
In the shadow of the season
To find a reason, to carry home
Said, "Lord please give me what I need"
He said, "There's pain and misery"
Oh, sweet oblivion
Calls me onward to her side
And feels her song deep inside
And find the reason
In the shadow of the season
To find a reason, to carry home
In the shadow of the season
To find a reason, to carry home
Find a reason
To carry home, to carry home
To find a reason
To carry home, to carry home
