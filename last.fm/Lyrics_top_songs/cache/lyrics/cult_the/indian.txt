Blood red wine, layered in time
I'm standing at the edge of the world
Please help me girl, please help me girl
I'm standing at the edge of the world
Please help me girl, please help me
Blood red wine, layered in time
Blood red wine, layered in time
Tristeza, make's me virgin
Tristeza, make's me virgin
I'm standing at the edge of the world
Please help me girl, please help me girl
Standing at the edge of the world
