Free baby
Free baby
Free baby
I shaved my head yeah wiped the sheet clean
Hangman has packed up I continue to dream
My words are broken, it's not easy to chew
So much unknown so much is knowing too
Lost I'm lost in your shadows
Lost I'm lost in your shadows
I explode in your belly, my skull in your hands
You drive me like honey across sour taste glands
Free baby, free again baby
Yeah semen is pure
It's divine in your wine
Lost I'm lost in your shadows
Lost I'm lost in your shadows
Yeah real girl you cut through my blues
Yeah real girl well you're golden to your shoes
You're really really really really really really real
Yeah real girl
Femme fatal with fur
Let's flow together. Let's come together
Let's swim together. Hypnotise each other
Yeah real girl you cut through my blues
Real girl well you're golden to your shoes
Real girl yeah a Femme fatal with fur
I explode in your belly my skull in your hands
You drive me like sugar across sour taste glands
I shaved my head yeah wiped the sheet clean
Hangman is packed up I continued every day
Lost yeah lost in your shadows
Lost oh yeah I'm lost in your shadows
I'm lost lost lost in your shadow
I am lost
