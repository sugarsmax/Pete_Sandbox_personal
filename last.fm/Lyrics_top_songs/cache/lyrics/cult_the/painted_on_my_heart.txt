I thought you'd be out of my mind
And I'd finally found a way to
Learn to live without you
I thought it was just a matter of time
Till I had a hundred reasons
Not to think about you

But it's just not so
And after all this time
I still can't let go

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Drawn upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, baby
And I've got your kiss still
Burning on my lips
Your touch on my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, baby

I've tried everything that I can
To get my heart to forget you
But it just can't seem to

I guess it's just no use
In every part of me
Was still a part of you

And I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Drawn upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, baby
And I've got your kiss still
Burning on my lips
Your touch on my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, baby

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Painted on my heart
Painted on my heart, oh yeah

Something in your eyes keeps taunting me
I'm trying to escape you
And I know there ain't no way to
To chase you from my mind

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Drawn upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, baby
And I've got your kiss still
Burning on my lips
Your touch on my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, baby

I've still got your face
Still got your face
Painted on my heart
Painted on my heart
Woo!
Baby

Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, my baby
Come on, come on, my baby
On my heart
Woo!
I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Baby
Baby
I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
