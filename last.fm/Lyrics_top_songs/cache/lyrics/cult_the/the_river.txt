I have travelled far
Unto this pagan hole
Where nothing is real
A place so pure and cold
She runs deep and strong
Twisting like a snake
A thousand miles long
A terror like a storm
On the river, on the river
Oh raining jangled tears
The shadows hold me near
Burn down the dawn
Now the furnace is gone yeah
Oh deep inside my heart
I can feel he is near me
Cold sweat drips down
Illusion and fear
On the river yeah
On the river yeah yeah
A Gunshot
A river demon
Baby burn down the citadel
Hands of love hands of treason
Oh shift the doctor, ditch the bones
On the river, on the river
Turnaround, turnaround yeah turnaround
Beating the darkside, yeah yeah yeah
The darkside yeah yeah
Turnaround darkside yeah turnaound
Give me the darkside
Yeah yeah...
I have travelled far
Unto this pagan hole
Where nothing is real
A place so pure as gold
Deep inside my heart
I can feel he is near me
Cold sweat drips down
Illusion and fear
On the river
On the river
On the river...
