Give me your body
Give me your mind
I wanna cross your borders
I wanna take my time
I know the feeling
When you're standing beside
And when I face you
My doors open wide
Can't get, I can't get
Can't get close enough to be close to you
Can't get, I can't get there
An inch is a canyon
I'll pay you my attention
If you invite me inside
Show me your country
I'll be still and quiet
Take me to your darkest corner
Show me what you're trying to hide
I've got a little fear
But it's the reverent kind
Can't get, I can't get
Can't get close enough to be close to you
Can't get, I can't get there
An inch is a canyon
I can't get there
Get there without you
I can't get there
Get there without you
I've got a shovel babe and you're a coal mine
I wanna get there
I can't get there
Get there without you
I can't get there
Get there without you
I'm a diver love and you're the ocean
I wanna get there
Give me your hands
Give me your hands
Put mine on you
Wanna feel, wanna feel me get to you
Give me your hands
Put mine on you
Wanna feel it, wanna feel it, wanna feel it
Can't get, I can't get
Can't get close enough to be close to you
Can't get, I can't get there
An inch is a canyon
