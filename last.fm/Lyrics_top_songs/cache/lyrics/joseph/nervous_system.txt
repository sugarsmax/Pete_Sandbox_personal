The best part about it is we're still in the fight
And I know this is the deep end, but we can still survive
What if we find out? Don't have to struggle to try
The harder you thrash, the more likely we'll end up capsized

You think you've made your way out of the deep, but there's a ripple effect
It's not over yet
You think you're stronger when you scream, but then you can't catch your breath

No, it's not selfish if you save yourself
Don't feed the paranoia, that won't help
It's in your head and it's under your skin
I know that you can calm the storm in your nervous system

The worst part is watching how you push me away
And that I can't help you when you stir up your hurricanes
The good and the bad in us are like night and day
The noise that you're making's drowning out what you meant to say

You think you've made your way out of the deep, but there's a ripple effect
It's not over yet
You think you're stronger when you scream, but then you can't catch your breath

No, it's not selfish if you save yourself
Don't feed the paranoia, that won't help
It's in your head and it's under your skin
I know that you can calm the storm in your nervous system

If I try to save you now
You'll spin us out, you'll take us down
And say it's me, catastrophe
Can't help you now if I'm drowning
Hold yourself, say you're okay
Say you're the one who keeps you safe
In your nervous system

Save yourself
Don't feed the paranoia, that won't help
It's in your head and it's under your skin
I know that you can calm the storm in your nervous system
Save yourself
Don't feed the paranoia, that won't help
It's in your head and it's under your skin
I know that you can calm the storm in your nervous system
