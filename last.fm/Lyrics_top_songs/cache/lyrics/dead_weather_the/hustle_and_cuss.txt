Knock on the door and the door knocks back
The joke never go no further than that
Fire goes back inside the match
Back down the stack

And we hustle and cuss
Lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Lick on the dust

Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
When you muscle and fuss
Muscle and fuss and lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust

When we were young, a different kind of fun
Playing in the mud, it meant something else
Now we hustle and cuss
You hustle and cuss

Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
You hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
When you muscle and fuss
You muscle and fuss and lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust

You're easy to fool and easy to catch
And I don't know if I want you to match my bets, yeah
You hustle and cuss, lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss and you lick on the dust

And we hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust
Hustle and cuss
Hustle and cuss and lick on the dust

When you muscle and fuss
Hustle and cuss
Muscle and fuss
Muscle and fuss
And lick on the dust
