Yeah, I love you so much
I don't need to resist
I don't need to exist
Dripping blue blood from the wrist
I don't need to resist
Yeah, all the neighbors get pissed
When I come home, I make 'em nervous

Come home
Come home
Yeah, I make 'em nervous

Crack a window, crack a broken bone
Crack your knuckles when you're at home
Lick an ice cream cone
Crack a bone
Crack a bone
Crack a bone

Crack a bone
Crack a bone
Crack a bone

All you had to do was ask
Who is it that wears the mask?
When you put me to task
You know you leave me broke and shirtless
Check your lips at the door, woman
And shake your hips like battleships
Yeah, all the white girls trip
When I sing at Sunday service
Sing at Sunday service
Sing at Sunday service
I sing at Sunday service

Sing
Sing
Sing

I only got one face, da da da da
I tried too long to erase
You know if I left, da da da da
I wouldn't leave a trace
I wouldn't leave a trace, da da da da
I wouldn't leave a trace
If I left you woman, you know
I wouldn't leave a trace
I wouldn't leave a trace
I wouldn't leave a trace
I wouldn't leave a trace
I wouldn't leave a trace
I wouldn't leave a trace

If I left, you'd never see me again
You'd never see me again, mm
You'd never see me again
I wouldn't leave a trace
You'd never see me again
