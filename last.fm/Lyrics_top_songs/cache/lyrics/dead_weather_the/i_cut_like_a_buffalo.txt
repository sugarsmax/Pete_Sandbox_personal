Yeah, you know I look like a woman
But I cut like a buffalo
Stand up like a tower, tall
Then I fall just like a domino

Yes, well, you can do me if you want to, hey
Do whatever makes you happy
You should try to take it easy on me
'Cause I don't know how to take it

You're a prick with a pin woman, yeah

Wake me up when you're broke
Only if it's broken
You know I treat you like a joke
But you can't tell when I'm jokin'

Yeah, you cut a record on my throat, yeah
But the record's not broken
Cut a record on my throat, yeah
But the record's not broken

Is that you chokin'?
Is that you chokin'?
Is that you chokin'?
Hey! Or are you just jokin'?

Yeah, you know I look like a woman
But I cut like a buffalo

Wake me up when it's broke
Just like a woman
Cut a record on my throat
Then you break me wide open

Is that you chokin' with me?
Hehe, yeah

You can hit me if you have to
Whatever makes you happy
But don't take it easy on me
I'll never take it easy

Yeah, you know I look like a woman
But I cut like a buffalo
Stand up tall like a tower
Then I fall like a domino

You're a prick with a pin, woman
Push it into my skin, girl
I'm a prick when I sin
And I know I can't win

Yeah, I look like a woman
And I cut like a buffalo
