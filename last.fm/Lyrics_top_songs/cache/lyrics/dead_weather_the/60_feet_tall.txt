You're so cruel and shameless
But I can't leave you be
You're so cold and dangerous
I can't leave you be
You've got the kind of loving
I need constantly

Hooked up to my motor all day long
We go down to Texas, up to Montreal
Two eyes none the wiser in the deep
Oh when the water gets hotter, both hands in the deep
You got my attention, oh, you got it all

I can take the trouble
'Cause I'm 60 feet tall

I know it ain't easy, I must tap your evil well
Boy, you come roaring like a bat out of hell
You drive me so reckless, you'll kill us all

I can take the trouble
I'll take you on


I can take the trouble
I'm 60 feet tall

You're so cruel and shameless
But I can't leave you be
You're so cold and dangerous
But I can't leave you be
You got the kind of loving
I need constantly

I can take the trouble
'Cause I'm 60 feet tall
