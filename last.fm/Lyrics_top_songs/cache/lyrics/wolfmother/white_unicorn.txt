And have you been to the carnival?
I would like to see you
And there's a whole lot of people there
Who would like to be you
And with the white unicorn
Across her shoulder
Makes you think that she might have been
Someone who's older, yeah

I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpent's vine
Now we live in another time

We could live together
We could live together

She lives on the borderline
That they call Hazel
And the tent that she lives in
It has the name of her lover, yeah

I know it's on your mind
And we've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpent's vine
Now we live in another time

Sister, can you tell me when the day turns to night
She left without a word and wondered inside
How many days must I still wonder why
And see her face in every passerby

We could live together
We could live together


And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpent's vine
Now we live in another time

We could live together
We could live together
We could live together
