Uh!

What did you see, girl, on the love train?
I said, what did you see, girl, on the love train, now?
I said, I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh
I said, I gotta get back, girl, on the love train-a

I saw different faces and different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh
I saw different faces and different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh

What did you see, girl, on the love train?
I said, different luck is with no name
You're tellin' me all things are the same
I said, I gotta get back, girl, on the love train

I saw different faces and different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh


I saw different faces and different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh
I saw different faces, different places
I gotta get back, girl, on the love train, oh

Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, ow!
