Wild!

I fell down in the desert, baby, yeah
Well, I had nothin' but a piece of paper, oh yeah
I had to write a-somethin' down
And I found myself alone
Then I let go of everything into another dimension

The purple haze is in the sky
See the angel's wicked eye
All these things we must try
Until we see the reasons why, oh yeah

Lightning crash on the hill tonight, yeah
And I got a feeling everythin' is gonna be alright
Then a horse came a-runnin' to me
I said, we're gonna go to the sanctuary
Then a storm began to blow into another dimension

And purple haze is in the sky
A-see the angel's wicked eye
All these things we must try
Until we see the reasons why, yeah-yeah

I got lost in the desert, baby, yeah
I found temples made out of paper, oh yeah
They were drummin' with the golden bones
Buildin' dreams in front of their homes
Then I let go everything into another dimension
Yeah
