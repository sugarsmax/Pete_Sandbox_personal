I come from San Francisco
Bringing beats to burn yo
Keep the faders pumping, pumping, yeah
All the girls they jump up in my face
Hear the bass kick
Like a roundhouse
Gold Chains, motherfucker, is knocking your lights out
Knock boots with your girl, all you do is step to school
Her properly, spread my hip-hop philosophy
Don't need money, just beats and love
As I school this mic, you know, you're the one I'm thinking of
Lovely girl, I've traveled round the world
You want to run with me? I got to come, indeed
You want expensive things, huge diamond rings
Silk sheets in the bedroom - these things I bring...
Yeah, right! You think I waste my money on all that
When down at the Boom Room, I just ordered twenty DATs
And 50 Moogs, a couple of ARPs, five 808's
As I take over the pop charts

Groove domination, the hard beat mystic
Non-materialistic, witch-doctor
I got the bass degree, it's my PhD
Complements of hard beat university

Now I can see in your eyes, you wish you were me
Instead of some little fish, punk MC
I got raps for your mind and raps for your girl
You wonder where she is? She's with me
Halfway round the world: Bangkok, Thailand
The scene is set: "I'll sell your lady as a sex slave to pay my rent!"
Off to Germany, clock my fräuleins
The beats to move the dance floor, California-style
World-wide distribution, I spread like a pollution
Gold Chains, motherfucker, is the hip-hop solution
Yo, airplay? Who the fuck needs that?
I just pump mad tracks on my portable DAT
Yeah, my headphones they're large
My speakers are in charge
Cash advance on my vocal chords, like a VISA card
