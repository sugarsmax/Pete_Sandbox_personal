Do you recall its name?
As it suggested beck and call, this face and heel
Will drag your halo through the mud, ash of Pompeii
Erupted in a statue's dust, shrouded in veils
Because these handcuffs hurt too much
Still scalping this ticketless applause
And when they drag the lake, there's nothing left at all

Sutured, contusion
Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said, "I've lost my way"
Even if this cul-de-sac would pay
To reach inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling-clear blackened ice
And when they drag the lake, there's nothing left at all

I've defected
I've defected
I've defected
I've defected

Sutured, contusion
Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said, "I've lost my way"
Even if this cul-de-sac did pay
To reach inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling-clear blackened ice
And when they drag the lake, there's nothing left at all

I've defected
I've defected
I've defected
I've defected


Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague
Said, "I've lost my way"
Even if this cul-de-sac did pay
Beyond the anthills of, beyond the anthills of
Said, "I've lost my way, yeah"
Even if you, even if you
Even if you, who reached inside a vault
Whatever be the cost
Sterling-clear blackened ice
And when they drag the lake, there's nothing left at all

I've defected (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
(Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
I've defected (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
(Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
I've defected (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
(Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
I've defected (Drag your vessel, punch your clock in)
