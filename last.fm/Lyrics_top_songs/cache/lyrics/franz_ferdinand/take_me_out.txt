So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you


I say, "Don't you know?"
You say you don't know
I say, "Take me out"
I say, "Don't you know?"
Don't move, time is slow
I say, "Take me out"

Well, I say, "You don't know"
You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out

I know I won't be leaving here 
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here 
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, "Don't you know?"
You say you don't know
I say, "Take me out"
If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here 
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here 
(With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you
