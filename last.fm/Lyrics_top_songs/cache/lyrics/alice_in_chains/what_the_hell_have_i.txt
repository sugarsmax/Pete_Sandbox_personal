The face before me flies
Laughs at me inside
Masks are made to hide the glow
Shining eyes
Distance between us grows
Feeding lies

It's hard to start things over
You can feel the fire around us
All the time, yeah

Something I should say
It takes you every day
What you give is not alive
Today
Your soul served on a plate
Throw it away

It's hard to start things over
You can feel the fire around us
All the time, yeah


It's hard to start things over, ah yeah
You can feel the fire around us all the time, yeah
It's hard to start things over, ah yeah
You can feel the fire around us all the time, yeah

All the time
What the hell have I?
Little pride
