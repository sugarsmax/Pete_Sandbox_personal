How the mind does shout for rest
When the body's shaking, yeah
Oh the tightness in my chest
Still your leaves I'm raking
Lord, is this a test
Was it fun creating, yeah?
My god's a little sick
And he wants me crazy

Who are you who can say it's okay to live through me?
Live to be part of me, you're a wrinkled magazine, yeah

Was it something that I said?
Was it how they're breaking, yeah
I'm so selfish, paying your rent
While your blood I'm taking

You spend me like a tree dirty dollar bills for leaves
Dark in a sea of my seeds and the tears on which you feed
You feed

Your body is a temple, a dormant altar to where
Infantile men lie around itching and nibbling
For a small piece of sanity of which you can not give
Shit!

Individuality
Buying penance with my soul
And a little Heaven spent
Why the hell not take it?

Thieves, parasites hide from life
You know they'll remember me
They are abhorred in self-worth
All that matters much to me
