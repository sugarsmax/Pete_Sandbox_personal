Hey, I ain't never comin' home
Hey, I'll just wander my own road
Hey, hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow, no
Say goodbye, don't follow
Misery so hollow

Hey, you, you're livin' life full throttle
Hey, you, pass me down that bottle, yeah
Hey, hey, you, you can't shake me 'round now
I get so lost and don't know how, yeah
And it hurts to care, I'm goin' down

Ooh, forgot my woman, lost my friends
Things I'd done and where I've been
Sleep in sweat, the mirror's cold
See my face, it's growin' old
Scared to death, no reason why
Do whatever to get me by
(Oh) Think about the things I've said
Read the page, it's cold and dead
And take me home (Home)
Yeah, take me home (Home), oh, oh
Take me home (Home)
Take me home (Home), yeah
Take me home (Home)

Hey, oh
Say goodbye, don't follow
