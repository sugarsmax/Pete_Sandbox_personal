It's all right, there comes a time
Got no patience to search for peace of mind
Layin' low, wanna take it slow
No more hidin' or disguisin' truths I've sold

Every day, it's something, hits me all so cold
You find me sittin' by myself, no excuses, that I know

It's okay, had a bad day
Hands are bruised from breakin' rocks all day
Drained and blue, I bleed for you
You think it's funny, well, you're drownin' in it, too

Every day, it's something, hits me all so cold
You find me sitting by myself, no excuses, that I know


Yeah, it's fine, we'll walk down the line
Leave our rain, a cold, trade for warm sunshine
You, my friend, I will defend
And if we change, well, I love you anyway

Every day, it's something, hits me all so cold
You find me sittin' by myself, no excuses, that I know
