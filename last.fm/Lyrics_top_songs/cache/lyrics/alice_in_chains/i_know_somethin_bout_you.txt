Why can't I take it all okay?
I like to dig and fuck around with your day

I'm gonna tell your mama
Yeah, I'm going to blackball your name
Ain't no way you'll go without me
Every chance, I'll make you pay

(On your face, in my space, I tell you) On your face
(I know somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you)
 I know somethin'
(In my space, on your face, I tell you) In my space
(I know somethin' 'bout you)
 I know somethin'

Why can't I put your words away?
I'd like to have more of you in my veins

I'm going to tell your papa
Yeah, I'm gonna try and ball your babe
Your gold key don't fit my crapper
Ain't got no shit today

(On your face, in my space, I tell you) On your face
(I know somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you)
 I know somethin'
(In my space, on your face, I tell you) In my space
(I know somethin' 'bout you)
 I know somethin'
(On your face, in my space, I tell you) On your face
(I know somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you)
 I know somethin'
(In my space, on your face, I tell you) In my space
(I know somethin' 'bout you)
 I know somethin'
