Six hours before
With an evil grin
Better brace yourself
Straightaway or win
Call power slide
Separates them all
Never touching the brake
Unapproachable

Evil Eye has set his plan
Erasing all
Evil Eye has set his plan
Erasing all

Pushed through the floor
Halfway through the turn
As we ride up high
The dirt starts to burn
Wheels of his heap
Hits the backstreet wall
Evil Eye has signaled
Unapproachable

Evil Eye has set his plan
Erasing all
Evil Eye has set his plan
Erasing all

Evil Eye will fall
Evil Eye will fall
Evil Eye will fall

Evil Eye (Unapproachable)
Evil Eye (Unapproachable)
Evil Eye (Unapproachable)
Unapproachable
Unapproachable
Unapproachable
Unapproachable
