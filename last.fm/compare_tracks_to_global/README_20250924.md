**Folder Organization:**
- **Artist comparison folders** (e.g., `queens_of_the_stone_age/`, `stone_temple_pilots/`): Contains cleaned analysis results, HTML visualizations, and mermaid diagrams
- **Analysis folders** (e.g., `qotsa_analysis/`, `stp_analysis/`): Raw scraped data and comparison analysis results

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Complete Analysis

```bash
python lastfm_complete_system_20250924.py --username YOUR_USERNAME --artist "ARTIST_NAME"
```

**Example:**
```bash
python lastfm_complete_system_20250924.py --username sugarsmax --artist "Stone Temple Pilots"
```

### Command Line Options

- `--username` / `-u`: Your Last.fm username (required)
- `--artist` / `-a`: Artist name to analyze (required)  
- `--quiet` / `-q`: Run in quiet mode with minimal output

## 📈 Sample Analysis Results

Based on Stone Temple Pilots analysis for user `sugarsmax`:

```
🎯 YOUR TASTE PROFILE: ALTERNATIVE TASTE - You prefer some deep cuts over popular hits

📊 KEY METRICS:
• Matched Tracks: 6 out of 10 personal tracks
• Loved Track Rate: 100% (all matches are loved!)
• Deep Cuts Preferred: 4 tracks ranked higher personally
• Average Rank Difference: -4.5 (negative = you prefer deeper cuts)

🎖️ MOST DISTINCTIVE PREFERENCES:
• Biggest deep cut: 'Sin' (Personal #4 vs Global #20)
• Most mainstream aligned: 'Plush' (Personal #8 vs Global #1)
```

## 📝 Understanding Your Results

### Taste Profiles

- **🎸 DEEP LISTENER**: Strong preference for tracks less mainstream (avg diff < -5)
- **🎵 ALTERNATIVE TASTE**: Moderate preference for deep cuts (avg diff -5 to -2)  
- **⚖️ BALANCED LISTENER**: Mix of mainstream and personal favorites (avg diff -2 to +2)
- **📻 MAINSTREAM ALIGNED**: Taste matches popular opinion (avg diff +2 to +5)
- **🏆 POPULAR FOCUSED**: Strong preference for mainstream hits (avg diff > +5)

### Correlation Interpretations

- **Very Strong**: |correlation| > 0.8 - Your taste closely matches/opposes global trends
- **Strong**: |correlation| > 0.6 - Significant similarity/opposition  
- **Moderate**: |correlation| > 0.4 - Some correlation present
- **Weak**: |correlation| > 0.2 - Minimal correlation
- **Very Weak**: |correlation| ≤ 0.2 - No meaningful correlation

## 🔧 Extending the System

### Adding New Analysis Methods
1. Create new method in `RankingComparator` class
2. Add to `comprehensive_analysis()` method
3. Include interpretation logic

### Custom Visualizations
1. Extend `HTMLVisualizer` class
