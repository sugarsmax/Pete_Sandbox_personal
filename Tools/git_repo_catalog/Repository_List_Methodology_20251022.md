## Quick Start Prompt

**To replicate this process in Cursor Chat, use:**

> Scan my git workspace directory structure, extract git remote URLs for all repositories, categorize them by type and purpose, identify correct repository ownership from git remotes, verify and generate HTTPS links, then produce a comprehensive markdown repository index with file structure documentation.

---

## Overview

This document explains how a comprehensive Git repository index was constructed and can be maintained or reproduced by others.

## Purpose

The repository list serves as a **centralized reference** for discovering and understanding all Git repositories in a workspace directory, including:
- Repository ownership and organization
- Project types and purposes
- Key components and file structures
- Repository links for quick access

## Data Collection Methodology

### 1. **Filesystem Scanning**

The initial list was generated by scanning the workspace directory structure:
```bash
ls -la <GIT_WORKSPACE>/
```

**Where:**
- `<GIT_WORKSPACE>` = Your local directory containing all cloned repositories (e.g., `~/git_repos/`, `~/projects/`, etc.)

This identified repositories organized by type:
- Analytics & BI projects (Looker)
- MCP servers
- Development tools
- Utility and support projects
- Personal/sandbox repositories

### 2. **Repository Metadata Extraction**

For each repository, the following metadata was gathered:

#### Git Remote URLs
Each repository's actual source location was extracted using:
```bash
git -C <REPO_PATH> remote -v
```

**Where:**
- `<REPO_PATH>` = Path to individual repository (e.g., `<GIT_WORKSPACE>/repo-name`)

This revealed the **true ownership structure**:
- Repositories may belong to different organizations
- Some are personal or team forks under usernames
- Some are hosted on external platforms (GitHub) under different organizations

#### File Structure
Subdirectories and key files were catalogued to understand project structure:
- Source code directories (`src/`, `app/`, `lib/`)
- Configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Makefile`)
- Documentation (`README.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- Data directories (`data/`, `sql/`, `notebooks/`)

### 3. **Classification System**

Repositories were categorized by **type** and **purpose**:

| Category | Examples | Characteristics |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Analytics & BI** | Analytics dashboards, Looker projects | Dashboards, LookML models, SQL views |
| **MCP Servers** | Protocol implementations | Model Context Protocol servers |
| **Development Tools** | Plugins, SDKs, APIs | Extensions, development utilities |
| **Data Pipelines** | ETL workflows, orchestration | Airflow DAGs, data processing |
| **Utility & Support** | Configuration, helpers | Tools, shared libraries |
| **Personal/Sandbox** | Experimentation spaces | Collaboration, prototyping |

## Link Correction Process

### Issue Identified
Initial links may be incorrectly formatted as local file paths or make incorrect assumptions about repository ownership.

### Resolution
Actual repository ownership was verified by extracting git remote URLs:

```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
import os
import subprocess

workspace = os.path.expanduser('<GIT_WORKSPACE>')

for repo in sorted(os.listdir(workspace)):
    path = os.path.join(workspace, repo)
    if os.path.isdir(path) and os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, '.git')):
        result = subprocess.run(['git', '-C', path, 'remote', '-v'], 
                              capture_output=True, text=True)
        if result.stdout:
            url = result.stdout.split('\n')[0].split('\t')[1]
            print(f"{repo}: {url}")
EOF
```

### Link Format
All links should be standardized to **HTTPS web URLs**:
- **Autodesk repos**: `https://git.autodesk.com/{owner}/{repo-name}`
- **GitHub repos**: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo-name}`
- **Generic git**: `https://<git-host>/{owner}/{repo-name}`

This format is:
- ✅ Shareable with non-git users
- ✅ Opens in web browser
- ✅ Works behind corporate firewalls
- ✅ Universal across devices

## Key Findings

### Repository Distribution Example

| Type | Typical Count |
|------|-------|
| MCP Servers | 5-10 |
| Looker Projects | 3-6 |
| Development Tools | 4-8 |
| Utility/Support | 2-5 |
| Personal/Sandbox | 2-4 |
| **Total** | **20-40+** |

*Your actual counts will vary based on your repository collection.*

### Ownership Insights

Repositories typically span multiple organizations and individuals:
- **Corporate teams**: Shared project repositories
- **Business units**: Domain-specific projects (Analytics, Data, etc.)
- **Individual contributors**: Personal tools, experiments, forks
- **External sources**: Open-source tools, community projects

## How to Maintain & Update

### One-Time Setup

1. **Define your workspace**:
   ```bash
   export GIT_WORKSPACE=~/path/to/your/repos
   ```

2. **Create initial list**:
   ```bash
   python3 << 'EOF'
   import os
   import subprocess
   
   workspace = os.path.expanduser(os.getenv('GIT_WORKSPACE', '~/git_repos'))
   
   print("# Repository Index\n")
   
   for repo in sorted(os.listdir(workspace)):
       path = os.path.join(workspace, repo)
       if os.path.isdir(path) and os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, '.git')):
           result = subprocess.run(['git', '-C', path, 'remote', '-v'],
                                 capture_output=True, text=True)
           if result.stdout:
               url = result.stdout.split('\n')[0].split('\t')[1]
               print(f"### [{repo}]({url})")
               print(f"- **URL**: {url}\n")
   EOF
   ```

### Regular Maintenance

To keep the list current:

1. **Re-scan for new repositories**:
   ```bash
   ls $GIT_WORKSPACE | wc -l
   ```

2. **Verify links remain valid**:
   ```bash
   python3 << 'EOF'
   import subprocess
   import os
   
   workspace = os.path.expanduser(os.getenv('GIT_WORKSPACE', '~/git_repos'))
   
   for repo in os.listdir(workspace):
       path = os.path.join(workspace, repo)
       if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, '.git')):
           result = subprocess.run(['git', '-C', path, 'remote', '-v'],
                                 capture_output=True, text=True)
           url = result.stdout.split('\n')[0].split('\t')[1] if result.stdout else None
           if url:
               print(f"{repo}: {url}")
   EOF
   ```

3. **Update repository descriptions**:
   - Review READMEs for purpose changes
   - Check for new subdirectories or key files
   - Note any archived or deprecated projects

### Automation Suggestions

For larger-scale repository management, consider:

1. **Git repository crawler** (Python script)
   - Automatically scan all repos in workspace
   - Extract metadata from README.md and package files
   - Generate markdown output
   - Upload to wiki or document repository

2. **CI/CD integration**
   - Run scan on schedule (weekly/monthly)
   - Commit updates automatically
   - Generate reports on repository changes

3. **Web UI dashboard**
   - Interactive repository browser
   - Search and filter capabilities
   - Real-time status checks
   - Team insights and metrics

## Limitations & Caveats

- **Scope**: Only captures repositories in your defined `<GIT_WORKSPACE>`. Additional repos elsewhere won't be included.
- **Freshness**: Snapshot in time. Repository structures, purposes, and ownerships may change.
- **Archived repos**: Some repositories may be inactive or archived; links remain valid but projects are no longer active.
- **Access control**: Some repositories may have limited access; links are valid but you may not have permission to clone.
- **Network dependencies**: Link verification requires network access to git hosts.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **git**: Version control system metadata extraction
- **Python 3**: Automated scanning and metadata compilation
- **Markdown**: Documentation format
- **Git hosting platforms**: GitLab, GitHub, or custom git servers
