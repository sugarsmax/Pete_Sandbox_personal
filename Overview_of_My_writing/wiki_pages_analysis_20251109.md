## Documentation Style & Characteristics

### Structural Elements

**1. Hierarchical Organization**
- Clear H1, H2, H3 heading structure
- Multi-column layouts (two-right-sidebar, single column)
- Table of Contents macros for navigation
- Sidebar panels for supplementary information

**2. Heavy Use of Tables**
- Comparison tables (e.g., Field Name | ADP Name | Summary | Change | Backfill Strategy)
- Status tracking tables (Audit Name | Date | Status | Severity | Action Required)
- Event catalog tables (UI Command Name | ADP Name | Description | Using V2 Framework)
- Complex multi-column tables with color highlighting for emphasis

**3. Information Architecture**
- "On this page" panels in sidebars
- Status badges (WIP, Complete, Critical Issues Found)
- Color-coded highlights (light blue, light yellow, light green for different priorities)
- Cross-references to related wiki pages
- Links to external resources (PopSQL, Excel, Atlan)

### Content Patterns

**1. Disclaimers & Attribution**
- Consistent disclaimers: "Disclaimer: Authored by Cursor"
- Transparency about AI-assisted authoring
- Version tracking and last modified dates

**2. Technical Depth**
- Specific file paths (e.g., `IronLib/core/analytics/AnalyticsMgr.h/.cpp`)
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Function signatures and parameter details
- Architecture diagrams and data flow descriptions

**3. Systematic Analysis**
- Baseline analysis → Violation identification → Impact analysis
- Key Findings sections with Implementation Distribution statistics
- Complexity Analysis with percentage breakdowns
- Priority classification (Critical, Secondary, Push to Phase 3)

**4. Action-Oriented Documentation**
- "Recommended Next Steps" sections
- Questions embedded in tables for follow-up
- Status indicators (checkmarks for completed items)
- Backfill strategies and migration plans

**5. Cross-Functional Collaboration Markers**
- Questions tagged to specific teams/individuals
- Notes about needed engagement (e.g., "Need to engage with MFG DM Core team")
- Strategic alignment indicators
- Collaboration tracking

### Writing Style

**Tone:**
- Direct and technical
- Process-oriented
- Standards-driven
- Minimal marketing language or fluff

**Vocabulary:**
- Domain-specific terminology (component_name, domainIntent, lineage_urn, verHash)
- Autodesk-specific acronyms (PDMS, ADP, HSM, CAM, SSR, PSAT)
- Technical precision in field naming and definitions

**Formatting Preferences:**
- Code elements in `monospace`
- **Bold** for field names and emphasis
- *Italics* for notes and examples
- Strikethrough for deprecated terms
- Color coding for status (red=change needed, blue=note, green=approved)
