Gemini Showcase Thumbnail Generator
This script is actually meant to be run by the AI assistant using MCP browser tools.

For manual thumbnail generation, just ask the AI:
"Generate thumbnails for the gemini showcase projects"

The AI has access to browser MCP tools and can:
1. Read projects.json
2. Navigate to each URL
3. Take screenshots
4. Save them to the images/ folder
5. Update projects.json with the image paths

No need to run this script manually!
