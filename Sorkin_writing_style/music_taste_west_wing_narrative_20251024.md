# The Musical Taste Briefing: A West Wing Story

## VIDEO GENERATION SCENE SETUP
 SETTING:  The Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House - 
 CHARACTERS: 
-  Josh Lyman  (30s, energetic, animated, dark suit, carrying papers) - Deputy Chief of Staff
-  Toby Ziegler  (40s, serious, beard, rumpled suit, seated) - Communications Director  
-  Sam Seaborn  (30s, boyish, well-dressed, coffee cup in hand) - Deputy Communications Director
-  C.J. Cregg  (30s, tall, confident, professional attire) - Press Secretary
 STYLE:  Fast-paced "walk-and-talk" West Wing aesthetic. Characters move fluidly around the room, overlapping dialogue, quick cuts between speakers. Aaron Sorkin rhythm - sharp, witty, rapid-fire exchanges with physical energy. Characters gesture with papers, lean on furniture, interrupt each other naturally.
BLOCKING:  Josh enters bursting with energy, Toby already seated looking annoyed, Sam and C.J. follow Josh in. Characters move around table, pace while talking, Josh waves printouts for emphasis.

 INT. WHITE HOUSE - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY 
*JOSH bursts in with printouts. TOBY seated, annoyed. SAM and C.J. follow.*
 JOSH   
Okay, we have a situation.
 TOBY   
Josh situation or actual situation?
 JOSH   
I found someone's Last.fm data. Top Van Halen song? "I'll Wait."
 TOBY   
They prefer Sammy Hagar.
 JOSH   
Completely committed! Top of the World, 5150, the F.U.C.K. album—
 SAM   
That's what it stands for!
 JOSH   
Queens of the Stone Age—"My God Is the Sun" at number three. It ranks twentieth globally!
 TOBY   
You're offended by someone's music choices.
 JOSH   
I'm impressed! They know every deep cut but still acknowledge hits.
 TOBY   
Questionable Van Halen judgment.
 JOSH   
The Sammy era is underrated.
 TOBY   
Said no one ever.
 SAM   
Wait, they built a statistical framework? Kendall's Tau, Spearman correlation—
 TOBY   
To prove their music taste is statistically significant?
 JOSH   
That's someone who gets the mission!
 C.J.   
What mission?
 JOSH   
Being right about things no one cares about!
 TOBY   
That's this entire administration.
 JOSH   
Someone out there is listening to "5150" and not apologizing. That's beautiful.
 TOBY   
You need to go home, Josh.
 JOSH  *(heading out)*  
I'm making a "Sammy Was Right" playlist.
 SAM   
Sammy wasn't right!
 JOSH  *(from hallway)*  
"I'll Wait" is a masterpiece!
 TOBY   
Send Donna to check on him.
 C.J.   
You think he's making that playlist right now?
 SAM/TOBY   
Yes.
