# FY27 Operating Model

> **Disclaimer:** This document was generated by an AI assistant (Claude) in collaboration with the user.

---

## Objective

Move from "Developing" to "Successful" on the 9-box by end of FY27.

**Core principle:** Reduce Megan's cognitive load about you. Make your work visible, predictable, and aligned with her priorities.

---

## The Three Shifts

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| Breadth (plate-spinning) | Depth on owned deliverables |
| Reactive status updates | Proactive communication |
| Carrying invisible work | Visible, bounded consulting |

---

## Operating Cadence

### 1:1 with Megan

**Before each 1:1:**
- Prepare written agenda (you lead, not her)
- Include status on YOUR deliverables (not team's)
- Flag any deadline risks or changes BEFORE she asks
- If something slipped, name it and state recovery plan

**Structure:**
1. Your deliverables status (beat her to the punch)
2. Risks/blockers you need her help on
3. Decisions you need from her
4. Her items

**Rule:** No status update should appear in two consecutive 1:1s without resolution or escalation.

### Weekly Self-Check

Ask yourself every Friday:
- What did I work on this week that Megan doesn't know about?
- What should I have dropped but didn't?
- What deadline risk am I sitting on?
- What bad news am I delaying?

If answers exist, communicate Monday.

---

## Priority Management

### The Drop List

Maintain a running list of things you're choosing NOT to do. Share with Megan as needed to confirm alignment.

| Item | Why dropping | Megan aware? |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| (example) | Not on priority list | Yes/No |

### Priority Triage

When new work appears, ask:
1. Is this on Megan's priority list?
2. Does she know I'm doing this?
3. What am I NOT doing to make time for this?

If answers are No/No/Nothing — stop. Either get alignment or drop it.

---

## Consulting Boundaries

### The Intake Rule

- Formal requests: Use intake form. Track in Jira.
- Organic/casual asks: Use the "no" script below. Log as spike ticket if you proceed.

### Consulting Budget

Allocate no more than **15-20%** of weekly time to helping others. Track via spike tickets. When budget is spent, stop.

### The "No" Script (for organic asks)

> "I want to help with this. Right now I'm committed to [owned deliverable] for [date]. Here's what I can do: [bounded offer — 15 min max, or pointer to resource]. If that's not enough, let's figure out who else can take this."

**Key elements:**
- Acknowledge the ask (preserve relationship)
- Name your constraint (transparency)
- Offer something bounded (not abandoning them)
- Redirect (there's a path forward)

### Follow-up Discipline

If you help someone, you do NOT follow up to ensure quality unless:
- It directly impacts your owned deliverable
- Megan has asked you to track it

Otherwise: let it go. Their success or failure is theirs.

---

## Communication Principles

### Bad News Protocol

> "Bad news doesn't get better with age."

When you identify a risk or delay:
1. Tell Megan within 24 hours
2. Include: what happened, impact, recovery plan
3. Communicate to stakeholders broadly (don't hide it)

### Deadline Changes

When an ETA changes:
1. Update Megan first
2. Update stakeholders same day
3. Provide new realistic ETA (not optimistic)

### Status Visibility

Megan should never have to ask "where is X?" If she's asking, you've already failed.

**Proactive beats reactive.** Always.

---

## Stakeholder Management

### Realistic ETAs

- Pad estimates by 20-30% for unknowns
- Communicate ranges, not single dates, when uncertainty is high
- If you don't know, say so — then give a date when you WILL know

### Accessibility

Make sure stakeholders know:
- They can reach out to you directly
- They don't need to route through Megan
- You'll be responsive (within boundaries)

---

## Mode-Switching Tactics

You default to breadth. Depth requires structure.

### Deep Work Blocks

- Block 2-3 hours daily for owned deliverables
- No Slack, no "quick answers" during blocks
- Treat these as meetings you can't skip

### The Pause

When someone asks for help during deep work:
1. Pause before responding
2. Ask: "Is this urgent, or can I get back to you in [X hours]?"
3. If not urgent, defer. Actually defer.

### End-of-Day Check

Before leaving each day:
- Did I make meaningful progress on my owned deliverables?
- If no: what took the time? Was it worth it?

---

## Relationship with Jen

### Coordination Goals

- Understand her update cadence to Megan
- Align on Standardization project responsibilities
- Ensure you're not duplicating or conflicting

### Heart-to-Heart Topics

- How does she communicate status to Megan?
- Where does she see overlap/gaps between your roles?
- How can you help each other on Standardization?

---

## Standardization Project

Megan's feedback: "It's chaos."

### Your Role

- Help Megan run the project better (with Jen)
- Improve operational cadence between teams
- Align on urgency
- Comms should be PM/PgMt, not Megan

### What This Means

You're being asked to step UP on project operations, not just execute tasks. This is a leadership opportunity within the chaos.

## Metrics for Success

### Leading Indicators (track weekly)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| 1:1s where you lead with agenda | 100% |
| Deadline risks flagged before Megan asks | 100% |
| Spike ticket hours (consulting) | Less than 20% of week |
| Items dropped that weren't on priority list | Track count |

### Lagging Indicators (quarterly)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Owned deliverables on time | Majority |
| Megan's feedback on communication | Positive trend |
| 9-box movement | Developing → Successful |

---

## Action Items (Immediate)

| # | Action | Due |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | Heart-to-heart with Jen | This week |
| 2 | Reach out to Daniel Graham (visualization) | This week |
| 3 | Create "Drop List" and review with Megan | Next 1:1 |
| 4 | Block deep work time on calendar | Today |
| 5 | Prepare agenda for next 1:1 (you lead) | Before next 1:1 |

---

## Review Cadence

- **Weekly:** Self-check (Friday)
- **Bi-weekly:** Review this operating model against actual behavior
- **Monthly:** Assess leading indicators
- **Quarterly:** Check lagging indicators, adjust model as needed
