# Role Clarity and Delivery Diagnostic

> **Disclaimer:** This document was generated by an AI assistant (Claude) in collaboration with the user.

---

## Context

Feedback received from manager indicates concerns across four areas:

1. **Overburdened** — carrying too much
2. **Taking ownership where should be consultative** — overstepping role boundaries
3. **Not delegating enough** — not letting task owners own their tasks
4. **Not delivering timely on main ownership tasks** — delays on owned work

User frustration: feels delays have been defended with valid reasons, and tracks work meticulously via Jira, wiki, and Slack.

---

## Diagnostic Approach

**Goal:** Pattern recognition leading to a future operating model (not relitigating past incidents).

**Success Criteria (user-defined):**
- Manager trusts my judgment on when to help
- Stop having this same feedback conversation

---

## Phase 1: Self-Assessment Findings

### Initial Questions

| # | Question | Response |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | When you see a gap or risk on a project you're not owning, what's your default behavior? | **B: Flag it and offer to help** |
| 2 | How do you typically decide whether something is "your problem" to solve? | Formal intake form exists for team requests. Casual asks are juggled based on knowledge; defers when appropriate. |
| 3 | When someone else owns a task and it's not progressing, what triggers you to step in versus letting it play out? | Will not let someone "trip" — will help or point them in the right direction. |
| 4 | On a scale of 1-10, how uncomfortable are you watching something fail when you could have prevented it? | **1 (most uncomfortable)** |
| 5 | When overloaded, what's the first thing you sacrifice? | **B: Delivery speed on owned work** |

### Follow-up Questions

| # | Question | Response |
|---|----------|----------|
| A | When you "offer to help," how often does that help become ongoing involvement? | **B: Often becomes ongoing** |
| B | When you point someone in the right direction, do you follow up? | **C: Usually** |
| C | When you step in to prevent a failure, does the original owner take it back? | **D: Varies widely** |
| D | Do you have a personal definition of "consultative"? | Yes — "teach how to fish." Gets good feedback for this. **Volume is the problem.** |

### Volume and Visibility Questions

| # | Question | Response |
|---|----------|----------|
| E | Why is the volume of asks so high? | **Mostly B (responsive/helpful reputation), some A (unique skills)** |
| F | What drives your follow-ups? | Ensure quality, answer remaining questions |
| G | Has manager acknowledged consulting volume? | **A: Yes, absolutely. That's the catalyst for this conversation.** |
| H | How do you defend delays? | **A (here's what else I was doing) + E (felt attention was sufficient given priorities)** |

---

## Key Pattern Identified

| Stage | Behavior | Consequence |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | High discomfort with others failing (1/10) | Will almost always intervene |
| 2 | Step in to help / prevent failure | Takes on work that isn't owned |
| 3 | Help often becomes ongoing (not one-time) | Commitment grows beyond initial assist |
| 4 | Follow up on people helped | Quality assurance adds cognitive load |
| 5 | Unpredictable whether work returns to owner | No clean handoff; may retain indefinitely |
| 6 | Overloaded from visible + invisible work | Capacity exceeded |
| 7 | Sacrifice own delivery speed | Owned work slips |
| 8 | Manager sees: "Not delivering timely" | Feedback received |

### Critical Insight

Defense of delays ("here's what else I was doing") **confirms the manager's concern**. User says "I was doing valuable things" and manager hears "you prioritized other people's work over your owned deliverables."

---

## Phase 2: Priority and Decision Analysis

| # | Question | Response |
|---|----------|----------|
| I | What criteria do you use when deprioritizing owned work? | **E: Combination of all** (urgency, impact, difficulty, relationship) |
| J | Do you have explicit, documented priorities with manager? | **A: Yes, documented and aligned** |
| K | Do you agree with manager's priorities? | **A: Usually agree** |

### The Intention-Action Gap

- Priorities are documented and agreed upon
- User doesn't disagree with manager's judgment
- **Yet deviation happens in the moment when competing demands arise**

This is not a knowledge gap—it's an execution gap.

| # | Question | Response |
|---|----------|----------|
| L | What happens when someone asks for help during priority work? | **B: Try to give quick answer and get back to work** |
| M | How do you feel after helping when you "shouldn't have"? | **E + B: Don't see it as wrong, but feel the cost** |
| N | Could you stop helping if explicitly told to? | **B: Yes, but uncomfortable** |

### The "Quick Answer" Problem

"Quick" is deceptive. Each quick answer has a tail:
- Follow-up
- Clarification
- "One more thing"
- Cognitive residue (remembering you owe someone attention)

---

## Phase 2: Manager Relationship

| # | Question | Response |
|---|----------|----------|
| O | Does manager know you could stop if told? | **Concerned it's D: They might think I can't help myself** |
| P | What do you need to feel okay saying no? | **D (just need to do it) + E (need a good "no" communication plan—current declines lose trust)** |
| Q | Biggest fear about restricting helping? | **B (relationships suffer) + E (won't be seen as partner for tough/important problems)** |

### Core Fear

Not that things will fail—but that **you won't be valued anymore.** This is a value and belonging fear.

---

## Phase 3: Conversation Preparation

### Manager Conversation Context

| # | Question | Response |
|---|----------|----------|
| AA | What will manager focus on? | **All:** specific misses, specific over-helping, general pattern, burnout concern, questions about change |
| BB | Has she said "say no more" before? | **A: Yes, multiple times** |
| CC | What got in the way of past commitments? | Balance between plate-spinning (many things moving) and deep-diving (critical items to 100% completion) |

### The Real Problem: Mode-Switching

User is a **plate-spinner** by nature—good at breadth, keeping many things moving. But some work requires **sustained depth** to completion.

**"Say no" doesn't solve this.** Even with zero external asks, the default to breadth would persist.

### Why Past Commitments Failed

| Commitment | Why it failed |
|------------|---------------|
| "Say no more" | Doesn't address mode-switching; still defaulted to breadth |
| Spike tickets | Made helping visible but didn't cap it or force depth |
| Defending delays | Manager heard excuses, not behavior change |

---

## Toolkit for Today's Conversation

### The Core Frame

> "I've been thinking about why 'say no' hasn't stuck. I think the real issue is mode-switching—I default to breadth when depth is required. I need to get better at recognizing when something needs sustained focus and protecting that, not just from others but from my own instincts."

### Short Acknowledgments

- "You're right."
- "I see that."
- "That's fair."

Then stop. Don't explain. Don't defend. Let silence do work.

### The Redirect (if pile-on)

> "I hear you on these examples. I don't want to spend our time defending the past—I'd rather focus on what changes. What would you need to see from me?"

### The Ask

> "If I'm going to operate differently, I'll need your help. When I say no and someone pushes back, I need to know you'll back me—or tell me if you think I made the wrong call. Can we agree on that?"

### The Escape Valve (if emotional)

> "I want to make sure I'm hearing you correctly. Can you say more about that?"

### Response Bank

| She says | You respond |
|----------|-------------|
| "You missed X deadline" | "You're right. That slipped because I didn't protect the time it needed." |
| "You took over Y when you should have consulted" | "I see that. I stepped in when I should have stepped back." |
| "This keeps happening" | "It does. I've been thinking about why, and I think it's a mode-switching problem, not just a saying-no problem." |
| "Are you going to burn out?" | "I've felt stretched. That's part of why I want to change how I operate." |
| "What's going to be different?" | "I need to get better at recognizing when work requires depth, and protecting that time. I'm open to your ideas on how to make that real." |

---

## Conversation Goals

| Goal | What it looks like |
|------|-------------------|
| **Propose path forward** | Name the mode-switching problem; ask for structural support |
| **Align on expectations** | Clarify what "success" looks like in FY27 |
| **Manager believes:** | You're capable of changing, you have a plan |
| **Avoid:** | Blame without success recognition; relitigating past |

---

## One Page Summary

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Posture** | Listen first. Acknowledge without defending. Forward-lean when openings appear. |
| **Core insight** | Mode-switching problem, not just saying-no problem |
| **What's different** | Naming the real pattern. Not promising willpower—looking for structural change. |
| **Ask** | Air cover when you say no |
| **Avoid** | Defending past delays. Listing successes unprompted. Getting emotional. |

## Conversation Outcome (2025-01-06)

### Key Takeaways from Manager

| Topic | What Megan Said |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Performance standing** | Not PIP territory. Believes I can do the job. |
| **Context** | Transition year acknowledged. P5 stakes are higher. |
| **9-box rating** | Currently "Developing" — goal is "Successful" for next year |
| **Communication** | Feels we're missing each other. Wants proactive status on MY deliverables. |
| **Bandwidth** | She needs time back. Ali & Jen taking her capacity. Can't chase me for status. |
| **Perception** | Sees me with "weight of the world on shoulders" |
| **Visibility gap** | I'm working on things not on her priority list, things she's not aware of |
| **Standardization project** | Chaos — but that's the project, not me personally |

### What Megan Is Asking For

| Request | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Better job dropping things | Let go of items she doesn't care about |
| Anticipate status questions | Come to 1:1 with agenda; beat her to the punch |
| Communicate deadline changes broadly | Flag early and wide, not late and defended |
| "Bad news doesn't get better with age" | Surface problems earlier |
| Provide realistic ETAs | Stakeholder management improvement |
| Help run Standardization project better (with Jen) | Operational leadership, not just execution |

### Diagnostic Confirmation

| What we diagnosed | Megan's feedback |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Manager may think you can't change | "Believes I can do the job" — more positive than feared |
| Working on non-priority items | Confirmed: "items she's not aware of" |
| Visibility problem | Wants YOUR deliverables status, not team's |
| Weight of helping others | "Weight of the world on shoulders" — she sees it |
| Mode-switching / breadth vs depth | "Better job over dropping other things" |

### Action Items from Conversation

1. **Heart to heart with Jen** — understand her cadence for updating, coordinate on Standardization
2. **Better at dropping things** — let non-priority items go
3. **Reach out to Daniel Graham** — visualization needs

### User's Asks to Manager

- Have more faith in my abilities; if not communicating, tell me
- Team architecture support has been hard to request

---

## The Core Shift for FY27

**Job is to reduce Megan's cognitive load about you, not increase output.**

She's not saying "do more." She's saying:
- Tell me before I ask
- Drop things I don't care about
- Flag problems early
- Own your deliverables status, not the team's
